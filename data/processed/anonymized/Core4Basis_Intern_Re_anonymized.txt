Executive Summary
Core4Basis Technology and Consulting Services is a consulting boutique SAP Basis
specialty firm. The company provides SAP system installation, upgrade, performance
optimization, security, backup, and cloud integration services. Its main goal is to assume
responsibility for customers' key infrastructures with best-in-class performance and
reliability.
During my internship, I was a very active member of the daily business processes of
the SAP Basis team. I learned checking the systems with the help of SAP GUI, preparing daily
and weekly reports, and performing backup controls and dump analyses. I also performed
user and authorization procedures. Besides that, I prepared weekly system status reports for
different clients, which included reading system logs, RFC connections, disk space usage,
memory space usage, and other important parameters.
A significant amount of my internship was devoted to being involved in the SAP
HANA patching process. Under the guidance of my supervisor, I performed full system
backups, downloaded the relevant .SAR files from SAP Support Portal, and uploaded them to
the respective directories. I powered down the system safely via SAP MMC and initiated the
update process through the hdblcm tool. I learned that careful planning, backup, and check
steps are so critical in system updates.
Moreover, I was taught SAP service management on the SUSE Linux and Windows
Server platforms by my supervisor. I learned to use terminal commands (df -h, top, ps -ef,
startsap, stopsap) and to work with directories. On the Windows platform, I was trained to
start and stop instances using SAP Management Console (SAP MMC) and to effectively
manage services.
Before the internship, my main goal was to learn more about SAP Basis
infrastructure and become familiar with the actual systems. This internship exceeded my
expectation. I learned the importance of regular system checks, proper documentation, and
collaboration in SAP system maintenance. In addition, I obtained experience which SAP Basis
requires as much technical knowledge as taking a high level of responsibility. This internship
assisted me in achieving technical skills and professional working ethics.

opportunity to learn how ERP systems at a large scale are serviced and maintained in a live
environment.
d) Professional and Ethical Responsibilities of Engineers
- Professional Responsibilities
Core4Basis engineers are required to deliver services accurately, dependably, and
responsibly. Every action of theirs, such as system alteration, role assignments, or
communication with clients, has a direct impact on mission-critical environments. They
therefore need to:
● Maintain high availability and stability of SAP systems
● Document every change and configuration accurately
● Update their knowledge and certifications periodically
● Maintain best practices and SAP guidelines
● Work collaboratively and communicate effectively with team members and
customers
- Ethical Responsibilities
The company has a strong ethical policy, though not in the form of a published public
"code of ethics." As day-to-day business, engineers at Core4Basis work under the following
ethical principles:
● Confidentiality :Engineers must protect all client data and system passwords from
unauthorized access or disclosure.
6

● Integrity : No short cuts or hidden changes. It all must be open and audit-able.
● Responsibility : Mistakes or risks are communicated in a timely manner, and
engineers take full ownership of their work.
● Respect and Fairness : Internal communication is with respect. Customers are
treated as equals regardless of company size or contract.
● Compliance : Engineers ensure that their actions are aligned with local law and
international standards (e.g., GDPR for data protection).
As an intern, I closely observed how these values are integrated in everyday work.
Engineers ensured that they always prioritized system safety, documentation, and ethical
behavior. I gained the knowledge that professional engineering not only involves technical
problem-solving but also about behaving responsibly, honestly, and with respect.
2. Summer Practice Description
During my internship at Core4Basis Technology and Consulting Services, I was part of
the SAP Basis team and supported various enterprise system administration-related
activities. Generating daily and weekly system status reports for various client companies
was my key responsibility. For report generation, I used SAP GUI and SAP FIORI Cockpit to
check system logs, backup statuses, performance statistics, and RFC connections.
I also worked through audit and log reporting procedures, whereby I pulled user
activity data from SAP transactions and logged it for compliance. I also had hands-on
experience in creating users and assigning roles with SAP GUI.
One of the biggest parts of my internship was assisting in the SAP HANA patch
update process. I was involved in performing database backups, downloading and copying
update packages, shutting down the system, and initiating the update with SAP MMC and
the hdblcm utility.
Besides, I have received initial training for OS-level SAP administration for SUSE Linux
and Windows Server. This included learning commonly used commands, SAP directory
structure familiarization, and observing the operation of starting and stopping SAP services
at the OS level.
Through completing these projects, I learned the routine work of an SAP Basis
consulting firm and had first-hand experience with the tools and methodologies used in
real-world enterprise environments.

3. Conclusions
During the course of my internship, I was involved in various activities as a member
of the SAP Basis team, e.g., reporting on the systems every day and every week, check on
dumps and backups, user creation and authorization processes. I was also actively involved
in the SAP HANA patch process, where I was taking system backups, downloading the
required files, shutting down the system, and executing the update using the hdblcm tool. In
addition, I was also trained on the control of SAP services at the operating system level in
SUSE Linux and Windows Server.
By performing these activities, I understood fundamental SAP Basis functionality and
appreciated the importance of regular system scans and documentation to ensure system
security. I refined my reporting skills by practicing using SAP GUI and SAP FIORI Cockpit, and
became skilled in log analysis and user management. MMC and hdblcm also taught me the
need to be careful while performing operations on live systems.
I acquired the significance of ethics, accountability, and communication in a work
organization environment while serving in a small capable team. The organizational
framework employed was systematic, transparent, and open to information exchange, hence
leading to the simplification of my learning.
The industry has the significant role of managing ERP infrastructure of business
enterprises. Cloud (AWS, Azure, GCP) and hybrid solutions are becoming more common.
System security, data privacy, and system optimization are becoming more critical on the
opposite side. The largest challenge for the industry is keeping up with technologies that are
constantly evolving while keeping the availability of the system high.
Over the next 5–10 years, SAP Basis processes will be dramatically changed by
developments in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud technology, and the Internet
of Things (IoT). Automated monitoring tools, machine learning–driven performance
improvement, and cloud SAP solutions will become mainstream. SAP Basis engineers will
therefore have to keep learning and adjusting to emerging technologies.

A ) Impact
My internship experience at Core4Basis gave me valuable insights into how SAP Basis
solutions could contribute significantly to global, economic, environmental, and societal
contributions. SAP systems constitute a significant component of digital infrastructure of
companies around the world. They are used in managing the core business processes like
finance, logistics, manufacturing, and human resources. The work I performed and
observed—e.g., daily system monitoring, backup management, log scanning, and software
patching—are technical and plain-looking tasks, but ones with extremely important
consequences when viewed as part of a bigger picture.
- Global Impact:
SAP Basis solutions enable companies with a global presence to function flawlessly
worldwide. Stable ERP systems ensure that supply chains, financial transactions, and data
exchange across geographical regions occur without disruption. If an ERP system of massive
scale fails, the consequence will be felt across the globe, resulting in delays in production,
shipping, or financial processes in various markets. The efforts of SAP Basis engineers,
including routine monitoring and patching, deliberately prevent such interference and
enable business continuity globally. Such reliability is required in today's globalized world
economy in businesses that manage cross-border businesses and trade.
- Economic Impact :
ERP systems have a direct effect on the economic efficiency and competitiveness of
organizations. System downtime will lead to colossal financial loss, production delays, and
even damage to reputation. SAP Basis engineers minimize the risk of operation by
conducting operations such as system checks, database backups, and software updates in
time. This enhances productivity, saves costs, and gives companies the potential to make
informed data-based decisions. The reports that we have prepared during our internship
assisted in decision-making by providing real system health and performance data. Marginal
improvements in system efficiency in large business organizations make a huge difference in
cost and enhanced resource utilization, which in the end contributes to economic growth.
- Environmental Impact:
SAP systems also help promote environmentally friendly business practices. ERP systems
integrated give companies the capacity to plan their logistics, production, and resource
planning in a more efficient manner that can reduce energy usage and waste. Cloud-based
SAP solutions, which are popular with companies, reduce energy usage through aggregated
infrastructure and shared resources. Through activities such as HANA patching and system
tuning, I acquired knowledge on how updates and performance improvements maintain
systems with less usage but are yet more efficient, indirectly reducing the environmental
footprint of IT operations.
9

- Societal Impact:
Error-free ERP systems guarantee that societal well-being is facilitated by industries providing
basic services. Fields such as healthcare, banking, transportation, and government
administration rely on secure and stable systems in order to offer services to millions of
people. SAP Basis engineers are tasked with ensuring that the systems operate without
interruption. Beyond this, security of data and confidentiality—a key part of SAP Basis—is a
major social matter nowadays in the digital age. Through performing user management,
authorization, and audit reporting operations, I understood how the engineers protect
sensitive data and maintain legal and ethical compliance.
In short, the engineering activities that I observed throughout my internship—system
monitoring, backup administration, log analysis, and patching—are technical in nature. They
have extensive impacts on global trade, economic efficiency, environmental sustainability,
and public trust in computer systems. With new technologies such as artificial intelligence,
big data analysis, and cloud computing defining the future, SAP Basis engineers will be asked
to implement these solutions even more responsibly. My internship experience showed that
all stable ERP systems have engineers behind them to make sure that companies can operate
securely, efficiently, and sustainably across the globe.
B ) Team Work
At Core4Basis, I was exposed and involved in a very collaborative team environment.
My senior SAP Basis engineers acted as my mentors, closely monitoring me, explaining
technical processes and reviewing my work when necessary. Senior SAP Basis consultants
with a background in computer engineering and information systems were responsible for
operating client systems, performing updates, and addressing technical issues.
My role in the team was to support them by giving them daily and weekly reports,
helping in HANA patch-related tasks, and learning basic OS-level administrative skills.
Meanwhile, while I assisted with easy tasks, the consultants were engaged in more complex
configurations, client conversations, and resolving issues.
We were in constant communication using Microsoft Teams, sharing work progress,
troubleshooting system problems, and planning patch schedules. Inside the office too, we
had short discussions to make quick decisions as a group. Our team was well-organized with
clear job assignments for each member and a supervisor [SUPERVISOR_NAME_008] general workflow.
The organization and performance of the team were greatly effective. Each person
knew their role, supported each other, and collaborated to achieve common goals. This
environment showed me the importance of interdependence, communication, and task
distribution in technical projects. It also showed me the importance of having a positive
attitude towards teamwork, showing that fruitfully cooperating teams can learn from each
other.

C) Self-directed Learning
While interning at Core4Basis, I realized that lifelong and autonomous learning is the
principle to professional growth in information technology. SAP Basis administration requires
continuous learning because enterprise systems, cloud computing, and security controls
keep evolving. Through my internship, I had experience in taking the initiative, independent
learning on a topic, and learning from beyond the given tasks.
I also identified other areas of professional practice knowledge. The areas are a more
thorough examination of SAP HANA architecture, Linux operating system management, and
advanced database backup and recovery strategies. I further emphasized the acquisition of
these soft skills: proper documentation, efficient communication, and time management
when working in a team.
Along with the support activities like the SAP HANA patching process, supplementary
information was needed to understand how to do the steps in backups, file management
updates, and shutdown and startup of the system.I learned this from official SAP documents
on the SAP Support Portal, technical manuals on the SAP Help portal, and the corresponding
training videos and discussion forums. My manager advised me to dig into these sources,
which allowed me not only to learn what to do, but why one had to do it.
Throughout the internship period, I had the practice of putting down notes on all the
work that I executed, the commands utilized by us in Linux, SAP transactions utilized during
some activities, and the overall process for system monitoring as well as patching. Having
such a record kept helped me recollect what I had studied and also acted as a personal
reference for future utilization.
This experience helped me build my independent learning skills, technical research
problems, and adapting to new things. It further revealed to me that in the world of IT,
experts have to refresh their knowledge continually, in order to keep up with emerging
technologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity software. My
internship made me urge to continue to learn, a skill essential to stay in the line of work as
an engineer.

4. Daily Activities
● Day 1 , 10.06.2025 - Installation and download
I met my supervisors and my teammates at the office and we talked about SAP Basis
Principles.
Firstly, I installed Microsoft Office 365 Programs, with all the meetings and
documents around here.
After that I received S-User ID and Password for SAP Me SubPortal from my
supervisor and I logged into the system.

Afterall i installed FortiClient VPN to access the customer's system.
At the beginning I had a problem which was about Name access requirements. I was trying
on the FortiClient 7.4 version on my Mac computer but Name was required so I checked
FortiClient Support. Probably my pc didn't support the 7.4 version and I installed the 7.2
version again.

● Day 2 , 11.06.2025 - SAP Structures and SAP GUI
I learned about the three-tier architecture of the SAP system: Presentation Layer,
Application Layer, and Database Layer. The users access the system through SAP GUI, which is
communicated with one or more application servers using a message server. The application
servers, in return, communicate with the database layer.I also checked SAP GUI logon pad,
where different system entries (clients) are saved. I saw that each entry has a system ID,
instance, and connection.

● Day 4 , 13.06.2025 - Audit Reporting Description
I worked with an Excel worksheet for tracking audit and authorization requests in the
SAP system. It addressed key control points such as active user and deleted user lists, admin
authorizations (SAP_ALL & SAP_NEW), critical authorizations, system parameters
(RSPARAM), and profile monitoring. Each request was included along with the corresponding
SAP report name and its status, overwhelmingly set to "Requested," with comments
referencing other sheets. I learned that information was extracted via SAP GUI and logged on
Excel for the purpose of supporting audit and access control processes.

I was given the responsibility of preparing the company's weekly reports under the
supervision of IÇ, and OT. I logged into the SAP system as a host user on my own, extracted
necessary data, and pasted it into Excel templates.
This exercise involved monitoring system activity and extracting critical data that was
required by the company. It helped me improve my SAP navigation, management of data,
and precision of reports.

● Day 7 , 18.06.2025 - Meeting About Daily SAP Reports
On this day, we had an online meeting with our supervisor [SUPERVISOR_NAME_005] how to prepare
daily SAP system reports. During the meeting, our supervisor [SUPERVISOR_NAME_004] to fill in the
daily control report and what each item means. He showed us how to check backups, dump
analysis, RFC connections (both inbound and outbound), database usage, and instance
status. We also learned how to write down problems if something is not working correctly.
This meeting helped me understand how to follow the daily reporting process and how to
use the SAP system more effectively.

● Day 8 , 19.06.2025 - Day 9 , 20.06.2025 - Preparing Daily SAP System Reports
(Individual)
After the training meeting, I spent these two days preparing actual daily SAP system
control reports. I followed the template shown by my supervisor [SUPERVISOR_NAME_003] SAP GUI to check
system information. Each day, I checked important items like backup status, dump analysis,
RFC connections, database usage, and instance performance. I entered the results into the
Excel report, just as we practiced. Sometimes, I also connected to the SAP Cockpit to confirm
system health and get more detailed data. I carefully followed the instructions to avoid any
mistakes and to make sure the reports were complete. This helped me practice what I
learned in the meeting and gain more confidence using SAP tools.

● Day 11 , 24.06.2025 - Day 12 , 25.06.2025 - Server Check for Two Companies
On these two days, I worked on checking the servers of two different companies.
- I looked at each server’s IP address, hostname, and operating system in the Excel file.
- Then, I used a remote terminal (like RDP or SSH) to connect to each server one by one
- I checked if I could log in using the username and password.
- If I could not log in, I wrote down the problem (for example: server is off, wrong password,
connection error).
-I also checked the SAP service accounts and other information to make sure everything is
correct.
-I marked the results in the Excel file using colors (green for OK, red for problems).
This task helped keep the company’s server list up to date and made sure all systems
were checked.

● Day 13 , 26.06.2025 - Day 14 , 27.06.2025 - SAP Log & Audit Report
Analysis for Legal Request
On this days, I was responsible for analyzing SAP user activity logs in response to a
legal investigation request. A client had filed a lawsuit claiming they worked overtime beyond
regular hours, and our company was asked to provide evidence of their SAP login history
from 2020 onwards.
● I accessed the SAP system and checked the user’s logon/logoff data for each month.
● I used audit tools such as SM20 (Security Audit Log), STAD, SUIM, and ST03N to
extract historical records.
● I reviewed transaction usage (e.g., VA03, SE16N, SM37) and audit texts like “Logon
successful” and “User Logoff”.
● I organized the results month-by-month into separate Excel files (e.g.,
01.01.2020–31.01.2020–CKAHRAMAN.XLSX).
● Each Excel file included detailed data such as terminal ID, transaction code,
timestamps, and program logs.
● I structured and named the files consistently to make them easier to archive and
analyze.
This task helped provide solid technical evidence for the ongoing legal case. It also improved
my skills in SAP log analysis, data organization, and compliance-related auditing.
