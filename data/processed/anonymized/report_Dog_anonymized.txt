end-to-end, and enhance transparency and efficiency across the organization.
During my internship, my primary area of work was in the Finance Module, which includes
core capabilities, such as invoice handling, payments and collections, exchange rate
variances, integration to accounting, additional budget requests, approval workflows, and
reporting. In joining the Finance team, I was involved in software development, debugging,
testing, and module integration.
Through trainings at Turkuaz Academy, I had gained knowledge on the architecture of the
project, database schema design, and coding standard in good detail. I practiced Agile/Scrum
practices such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives from which I had gained
knowledge on how large projects are organized and executed. I also gained hands-on
knowledge on tools like Visual Studio, Git Extensions, and MS SQL Management Studio.
The internship provided me with technical expertise in debugging and SQL stored procedures
and clean code principles (SOLID Principles) and service-oriented architecture (SOA). The
experience provided me with essential knowledge about working with teams and effective

changing business requirements.
d) Professional and Ethical Responsibilities of Engineers
- Professional Responsibilities
Employed engineers are responsible for critical systems and continued business operations
of the companies under Dogus Group. Each line of code, database tweak or system
integration affects the accuracy and speed by which money gets counted in your corporate
piggy bank. Therefore, engineers are expected to:
Be responsible for the robustness and quality of everything you build especially in key areas
like Finance.
Keep code changes and configurations all recorded, transparent and traceable.
● Bring reliability and performance into all build systems, especially mission critical
ones such as Finance.
● Recording of any changes to the code and configurations for possible inspection and
traceability.
● Adhere to industry best practices including SOLID Principles, Clean Code and
service-oriented design for scalability and maintainability.
● Successfully work on a team with analysts, product managers and other developers
in Agile/Scrum models.
● Demonstrate lifelong learning by adapting to new technologies, frameworks, and
paradigms in enterprise scale applications.
- Ethical Responsibilities
Dogus Teknoloji places great emphasis on ethical practice in engineering activities, reflecting
corporate values and legal compliance requirements. Engineers are required to:
● Confidentiality: Secure all company and customer information, both financial and
personal, from unauthorized access or misuse.
● Integrity: Provide honest solutions, without taking shortcuts that can diminish the
long-term stability and security of the system.
7

● Accountability: Take ownership of their work, promptly report errors or risks,
and actively contribute to finding solutions.
● Equity and Respect: Create a cooperative atmosphere where each person's
contribution is respected, and stakeholders are treated in a professional manner.
● Compliance: Ensure that all processes and systems are compliant with local laws and
international standards (e.g., GDPR for data protection and accounting standards for
financial systems).
As an intern, I had the opportunity to witness these responsibilities and values at work. For
example, when we had to react on issues with the Finance Module or put updates of
changed code into production, each step was observed, written down and signed by our
supervisor. This provided that not only would there be technical correctness but also
professional accountability and ethical responsibility.
2. Summer Practice Description
2.1 Main List of Activities
Activity 1: Debugging and Fixing Missing Mail Parameter in E-Invoice Creation
8

● Computer Engineering Related Tasks Performed:
I observed an issue where the system was unable to generate, or create, an e-invoice in the
event this parameter was omitted. After performing step-by-step debugging, it was evident
the execution flow was halted, and did not call e-invoice related methods, when the mail
sending parameter did not exist. Thus, I adjusted the given piece of code to state that, while
it may not be mailed, in any case, the invoice is still processed as an e-invoice.
● Relationship to Major Studies:
This assignment connects directly to my previous courses in software engineering including
Programming Languages, Software Design, and Enterprise Systems, where debugging and
error handling were fundamental.
● Interesting and Challenging Aspects:
The process of discovering why the process stopped quietly was challenging - I had to
unwind a chain of method calls to either a missing dependency or issues with the system
itself.
● Learning Outcome:
I developed my debugging abilities, established an efficient way to handle "optional
parameters" and learned how even a small missing parameter could derail an important
financial function such as e-invoicing.
Activity 2: Transition from DLL-based Library Access to Service-Oriented
Architecture (SOA)
9

● Computer Engineering Related Tasks Performed:
During the course of my time with the company, a library transition was happening from a
DLL based implementation to a service-oriented architecture. I contributed to this effort by
writing convenient methods to serve the new libraries. This allowed the system to leverage
functionality through APIs, rather than relying on local DLLs, thus establishing better
modularity and scalability.
● Connection to Program Learning Outcomes:
This activity is directly related to the Software Architecture, Web Services, and Distributed
Systems courses where service-oriented approaches and API developed are introduced.
● Interesting and Challenging Features of Task:
It was exciting and challenging to see how legacy systems can be updated and modernized. I
found writing the methods to provide as a service distinctly challenging and required a clear
understanding of the current functionality and adapting that to a service-oriented
architecture.
● Learning from the Task:
I have a greater understanding of a service-oriented architecture, I experienced writing and
exposing methods to consume through a service, and that modular design is easier to
maintain and integrate into legacy systems.
Activity 3: Default “Dahili Fatura” Selection for D-Charge in Invoice Acceptance
Process
10

● Computer Engineering Related Tasks Performed:
I was working on a requirement that would set the default value in the invoice acceptance
screen under D-Charge Institution for "İşlem Yapılacak Cari Hesap Ürünü" to "Dahili Fatura".
Earlier, the field was set to value "Y.İÇİ SATICI". I looked at the code and made the required
changes where the correct default selection was being triggered for D-Charge. During this
task, I also had an issue due to the pre-production environment not having the institution's
real VKN, and I was able to eventually get it resolved by consulting with the analysts and
planning a test data update.
● Connection to Major Studies:
This task readily connects to courses on enterprise application development and
database-driven systems, where customizing and engineering requirements are commonly
practiced.
● Interesting and Challenging Aspects:
It was interesting to see how a small change to a default value can have an impact on user
efficiency. It was challenging to work with analysts to figure out the best way to address data
concerns in a limited environment.
● Learning Outcome:
I learned about requirement driven software customization and improved my skills in
working with business analysts. Additionally, I learned how to manage environment-specific
data gaps during the development process.
2.2 Activity Analysis
Activity Selection: Default “Dahili Fatura” selection for D-Charge in the invoice
acceptance process.
● Details of the Activity:
I was given a requirement during my internship related to the Turkuaz ERP system. More
specifically, within the D-Charge institution, when users accept invoices, the field “İşlem
Yapılacak Cari Hesap Ürünü” (Account Product) defaults to “Y.İÇİ SATICI”, which is a problem.
The incorrect default adds a few unnecessary steps for users, in addition to creating
confusion because business logic should default to “Dahili Fatura”.
I was tasked with determining where the existing code used to default this field, reviewing
existing code, and updating it to default to "Dahili Fatura” within D-Charge.
11

● The development process included:
- Reviewing the current implementation and pinpointing the section where
the default values were set.
- Revamping the logic to check for the institution (D-Charge) conditionally.
- Assigning the appropriate default ("Dahili Fatura") accordingly.
- Corresponded with the business analysts to clarify testing matter: the real
D-Charge’s VKN (Tax ID) in pre-production was not present so a full testing
could not be completed.
● Performance Indicators / Metrics:
Various aspects of performance are worth noting:
- User efficiency: The new default lessened the number of clicks manually
required by users for each invoice acceptance. Previously, users had to
manually adjust the field, whereas now it is automatically correct.
- Reduction of errors: The selection of incorrect options (e.g. selecting "Y.İÇİ
SATICI" instead of "Dahili faturası") has been removed, reducing the
potential for mismatches with accounting.
- Consistency of the system: The solution brought D-Charge's behavior inline
with that of DOS institution, ensuring consistency to those across different
institutions.
- Reliability of testing: The lack of real VKN in pre-production had been a
blocker. Working with analysts brought better attention to the quality of the
environments data.
12

● Problematic Issues Identified:
- Gap of the Testing Environment: The core of the issue was the lack of
D-Charge's actual VKN in the pre-production database. This made it
impossible for developers to thoroughly assess functionality through testing.
The extend of this problem pointed to a larger issue of keeping synchronized
and accurate test data across environments for reproducible testing.
- Manual Data Dependency: This system relied on user correction prior to the
change implementation, which was inaccurate and not a good use of time.
This dependency leads to time ineffectiveness in the invoicing process.
- Business Impact Risk: The scenario of defaulting into a wrong account
product could lead to accounting errors, financial discrepancies, and user
dissatisfaction for customers
Engineering Relevance:
This activity reflects five core Computer Engineering practices.
- Requirements engineering (decoding the analyst's request),
- Customizing software in enterprise systems,
- Debugging and dealing with environment-specific issues,
- Collaborative problem solving with analysts.

2.3 Project
Project Title: Improving Test Reliability in Enterprise Systems: Handling Missing VKN Data
for D-Charge in Pre-Production
● Description of the Activity:
The goal of the project was to improve the reliability of the invoice acceptance process for
the Turkuaz ERP system. The functional requirement was to have the field “İşlem Yapılacak
Cari Hesap Ürünü” default to “Dahili Fatura” inside the D-Charge facility. During the process
of developing the functionality, I encountered a significant issue from an engineering
standpoint: the real D-Charge VKN (Tax Identifier) was not present in the pre-production
environment, so I could not fully test the new functionality.
In some ways, this highlighted a larger problem beyond the specific requirement: the
absence of synchronized and realistic test data across environments.
● Problem Definition:
Main Problem : The pre-production environment contains D-Charge's false VKN allowing for
only limited testing which carries risk when deploying in the production environment.
Engineering Connection: This is not unusual in a large software project where the test
environment lacks the completeness or accuracy of production data.
● Analysis of the Problem:
Current State: Developers used incomplete or outdated test data which didn't allow for
reliable preproduction validations.
Consequences:
* Increased likelihood of finding problems only after the deployment.
* Tedious debugging cycles, and more expensive fix costs in production.
* Dependence on analysts to manually check for missing data.
Metrics:
* Number of incomplete or failed tests cases owing to VKN requirement.
* History and time with the analysts, coordinating data clarifications.
* The higher likelihood of a users unhappiness or financial discrepancies from deploying a
wrong default to production.
● Proposed Solution:
To address this issue, I worked with analysts to initiate the request for the insertion of the
proper D-Charge VKN in pre-production. In the more long-term, outside of this interim
solution, there is a possible option of starting to utilize Test Data Management (TDM)
approaches, with potential options being:
- Keeping data sets in sync, between prod and pre-prod.
- Using dummy or de-identified production data to test.
14

- Updating configurations, for environments to ensure significant identifiers
(e.g. VKNs) are always in the test database.
● Literature Survey and References:
The issue of unrepresentative test data is common in enterprise systems (IBM, Test Data
Management Best Practices, 2022).
Op-eds and books introducing "shift-left testing" and continuous integration pipelines stress
how reliable and automated testing can only be achieved with effective test environments.
Research in the academic literature (e.g., IEEE Software, 2021) suggests that mocking and
synthetic data generation can help increase reliability without having to deal with data
privacy.
● Expected Benefits of the Solution:
- Improved Testing Reliability: Assures essential business rules (such as defaulting to
“Dahili Fatura”) will be validated pre-production.
- Reduced Deployment Risks: Fewer production errors and smoother go-livess
- Enhanced Developer Productivity: Less reliance on analysts for missing data.
- Business Continuity: Correct defaults ensure financial data is in sync and lessen the
number of manual interactions by users.
● Conclusion:
This initiative not only addressed the particular concern of missing VKN in D-Charge
pre-production testing, but also illuminated the need for more well-managed testing data in
enterprise software engineering in the future. Determining which short-term fixes can be
combined with best practices is an important goal for improving the reliability of enterprise
systems.

3. Conclusions
During my internship at Dogus Teknoloji, I had a chance to be part of the Finance Module of
the Turkuaz Project, which is one of the largest digital transformation projects of Dogus
Group. During this time, I realized how enterprise scale software systems are designed,
developed, tested, and deployed in real corporate settings.
By attending to many different tasks—debugging issues in the e-invoicing process,
contributing to the service transformation of accounting processes, implementing default
value logic in invoice approval, and training on SQL stored procedures, as well as SOLID
principles—I greatly developed my technical skills. These tasks made me realize the
importance of rigor, scalability, and high-quality coding standards in enterprise systems.
Additionally, I formalised understanding of the project’s architecture, database design, and
data coding standards from attending trainings in the Turkuaz Academy. Also, attending Agile
strategies—daily standups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives—enabled me to
observe how teamwork, communication, and planning can push progress on large system
implementations.
I realized that, as a professional, there was more to my responsibility than my technical
capability. Every change I made to the code was to be documented, reviewed, and tested
precisely to support the authenticity of the system and continuity of business. However,
ethical values such as confidentiality, accountability, and fairness could not just go through
the workflows shaping a professional atmosphere where everyone saw technical and ethical
as equally valuable.
In summary, I am able to consider my internship at Dogus Teknoloji to be a comprehensive
positive experience in which I improved my understanding of enterprise software
development, improved my problem-solving and debugging capabilities, and had the
experience of being part of Agile based teams in the corporate workplace. But most
importantly, the experience demonstrated to me that being a computer engineer is so much
more than solving problems - it is having responsibilities, working collaboratively, and helping
to guide an entire organization through digital transformation.
16

A ) Impact
I gained a lot of insight on how Indie and enterprise software engineering can have global,
economic, ecological, and social implications, while interning at Dogus Teknoloji. During my
internship I worked on things like debugging, transforming services, developing SQL
statements, and automating financial processes. So, although my scope did not extend to
anything much larger than each of those and what was happening in the background, I found
these insignificant "technical" tasks to have considerable implications of larger outcomes.
● Global Impact:
The Turkuaz Project has been developed as a digital backbone for the Dogus Group,
which is an international multi-sector entity. It is reliable and integrated systems that
enable financial transactions, logistics' coordination, and reporting between business
units. Even small performance enhancements or reductions of errors in systems all
contribute to cross-border operations functioning smoothly.
● Economic Impact:
Financial correctness and efficiency are very essential for the success of any
organization. I witnessed, through work such as automating invoice acceptance
defaults or debugging e-invoice background processes, how technical improvements
can lessen manual errors, save time, and adhere to financial standards. All these
improvements lead to cost efficiency and promote the company's competitiveness.
● Environmental Impact:
Turkuaz's digitalization of business processes reduces paper workloads and waste of
resources. Having focused financial operations and reporting allows companies to
make better plans for efficient resource allocation as well as reduced inefficiencies.
Alongside this, Dogus Teknoloji's adoption of cloud solutions and modern
architectures, allows for more energy efficient IT operations.
● Societal Impact:
When financial and operational systems operate correctly, they indirectly serve the
public good by providing services to millions of people through industries such as
automotive, retail, and finance. Secure and well-managed data processes also
protect sensitive information, demonstrating the increasing importance of digital
trust within the fabric of our society.
To sum up, even if my technical contributions were insignificant in comparison to the overall
Turkuaz Project, they provided a degree of insights in enterprise software development due
to its implications for broader corporate operations, business sustainability, economic
efficiencies, the environment, and confidence in technology at a societal level.
17

B ) Team Work
While at Dogus Teknoloji, I had the opportunity to work in a structured team-oriented
environment as a member of Team Armageddon, which is responsible for the Finance
Module of the Turkuaz Project. The team developed its work based on Agile/Scrum
methodology from the beginning, which allowed for development items to be prioritized,
work assigned and shared, and progress monitored continuously.
My daily routine often began with daily meetings, where each member updated the team
about their tasks and blockers. I also participated in sprint planning, reviews, and
retrospectives, which showed me how feedback, reflection, and forward planning were
essential for continuous improvement.
As an intern, I contributed to the project with the support of my buddy and senior
developers who assisted me with debugging, SQL training, and development tasks, teaching
me not only technical skills, but also the communication and collaboration aspects of being
in a successful working environment.
We used tools such as Microsoft Teams, Git Extensions, and Visual Studio, for sharing
progress, review of code and to communicate and coordinate development team activities
which essentially ensured that even minor issues were addressed immediately and team
members supported each other.
I discovered that teamwork was more than breaking apart tasks. It consisted of knowledge
sharing, jointly pursuing solutions to problems, as well as group accountability. This
experience helped me understand that a well-functioning team needs to build successful
enterprise projects beyond individual expertise.
C) Self-directed Learning
While interning at Dogus Teknoloji, I soon recognized that self-teaching and continuous
learning is necessary for professional development in large scale software projects. While the
structured training I received (mainly from Turkuaz Academy) gave me the fundamental
theoretical foundations for software architecture, database design, and coding principles, I
learned most of my refinements and knowledge through personal study.
For example, when I was testing and revising the missing mail parameter in the e-invoice
process or changing the first/default value selection for the invoice acceptance workflow, I
was required to read through documentation, review existing code, and try out different
solutions. This experience taught me how to investigate a problem by myself and implement
the solution thoroughly.
I further fortified my knowledge of SQL stored procedures, the SOLID principles, and
service-oriented architecture by not just learning the training material, but also
independently studying additional developer forums, and official documentation, and coding
best practices in those areas of study. This allowed me to continue to figure out not just what
to do, but why those practices matter in enterprise-scale systems.
18

Moreover, I made it a habit to record comprehensive personal notes, training applications,
and public training and application meetings when I took the course of code learning. The
notes served as a personal reference point I could use to return to complex concepts, and
they ultimately morphed into a learning journal that increased my learning rate.
During this internship, I enhanced my abilities to learn independently, adapt to new
technologies, and take charge of my own development. I now realize that in the IT
industry—an industry where frameworks, tools, and practices are always
changing—engineers need to become comfortable with self-directed learning as a skill that
lasts a lifetime to continue to be effective and relevant.

● Day 2 , 05.07.2025 - Turkuaz Project Introduction & Finance Module
On the second day of my internship, I began the morning with the Team
Armageddon daily meeting at 09:00. Following the daily meeting, I had my one-on-one with
my buddy, who provided an overview of the purpose and scope of the Turkuaz Project.
The Turkuaz Project is an integrated corporate software platform developed for
Dogus Group. The Turkuaz Project is comprised of multiple modules, including Vehicle, Parts,
Procurement, Customer Relations, Import-Export, Approval, Training, and Finance. The
purpose of the project is to consolidate the different business units under one umbrella,
digitalize the process, increase efficiency, and centralize management.
My buddy also described the roles of the Finance team, of which I am a member.
The Finance module performs many functions including, invoice functions, payments and
collections, foreign exchange differences purchase, accounting, extra budget approvals,
documentation, and financial reports. These functions allow all financial functions to be
systematically and seamlessly handled in the system.
The module centralizes processes such as invoice tracking, payment processing,
foreign exchange rate difference, and financial reports to ensure accuracy and efficiency. As a
Finance team member, my job is to manage the software side of these processes and
support the digitalization of the finance functions for the Turkuaz Project.

● Day 3 , 06.07.2025 - Turkuaz Academy Training (Architecture – Part 1)
After the daily meeting, I signed into Dogus Group SharePoint to access the Turkuaz
Academy training materials. These trainings were already prepared for interns, and I expect
them to take me around two weeks to complete. At the end, I am supposed to have a
thorough understanding of the Turkuaz Project's structure and architecture.
Today, I focused on the Turkuaz Software Architecture and Database Architecture
training and, because I took meticulous notes while progressing through, I made it through at
least half of the session. The training provided useful insight into the project's architectural
design, database structure, and technical architecture overall.

● Day 4 , 07.07.2025 - Architecture Training Continuation & General
Development Meeting
On Day 4 of my internship, I began at 09:00 by attending the Team Armageddon daily
meeting. After the daily, I continued with the Turkuaz Software Architecture and Database
Architecture training by moving onto the rest of the session. This portion of the training
focused more on practical examples of how business logic and the database were brought
together in the Turkuaz Project (see Figure 12).
Later in the day, I also attended the general development meeting, which occurs
once a month and encompasses all developers on the Turkuaz Project. The development
meeting allowed me to see the overall project progress, get updates from all teams, and see
how all development is being executed (see Figure 13).

● Day 5 , 08.07.2025 - Sprint Planning & Git Branch Strategy Training
On the fifth day of my internship, I started the morning with the Team
Armageddon Sprint Planning meeting, led by Levent Taskıran (Dogus
Teknoloji). During this meeting, the team reviewed the upcoming sprint
goals, discussed the tasks to be prioritized, and aligned on
responsibilities. This meeting helped me better understand the
Agile/Scrum process and how the team organizes their work in short
iterations to ensure steady progress.
Later in the day, I attended a second meeting focused on Accounting
Service Integration, presented by Yusuf Eymen Sezen (My Buddy) in
which the presentation was centered around how accounting processes
are being accommodated into services based structures with some
modularity and scalability perspective of Turkuaz Project. The
presentation would provide insight on how accounting processes are
digitalized and integrated with other parts of the system.
Later on, I also attended a Turkuaz Git Branch Strategy training, where
Git and GitExtensions were introduced and demonstrated in front of our group. This
introduction enhanced my current understanding of the branching model used in the
project, along with how developers collaborate effectively through version-control practices.
I also took some of my own notes during the training to help me better wrap my head
around the processes when performing similar tasks (Figure 14).

● Day 6 , 11.07.2025 - Day 7 , 12.07.2025 - Sprint Retrospective & SOLID
Principles Training
Throughout my two-day internship, I started my day with the Team Armageddon daily
meeting at 09:00, and then participated in the Sprint Retrospective led by Levent Taskıran. In
this retrospective, the team reflected on the achievements and challenges from the previous
sprint and set actions to improve for this next sprint, which was a great chance to see how
Agile methods and retrospectives work within the Turkuaz Project.

I attended the SOLID Principles and Clean Code curriculum (Figure 16). I started it on Day 6,
took notes initially, and completed it on Day 7. The training showed how the SOLID principles
are applied within the Turkuaz Project through practical coding examples in Visual Studio,
including class structuring and interfaces and refactoring code for readability. I have
completed personal notes (Figure 19) that I can reference to solidify my understanding of
clean code practices in enterprise-scale projects.

● Day 8 , 13.07.2025 - SQL Stored Procedure Training & Reflection Problem
Meeting
On the eighth day, I once again started the morning at 09:00AM with the Team Armageddon
daily meeting, where the team reviewed ongoing tasks and progress.
After the daily, I attended the training session titled “Turkuaz Trainings - SQL: Stored
Procedure (SP) Structure” (Figure 19). This training session presented the purpose of stored
procedures within the Turkuaz Project, explaining that SP's can standardize database tasks,
performance improvement and modularity across the system.
There were live demos in Visual Studio, going through a SP creation, including usage of
parameters, error handling and execution flow. This training gave me more insight to the SQL
layer of Turkuaz and how structured coding practices are utilized in its database structure.

Turkuaz Project
On the same day, I attended a meeting led by Yusuf Eymen Sezen
on the topic "Yansıtma Problemi" (Reflection Problem), which
focused on some technical issues surrounding reflection and the
impact on system performance and accuracy problems. This
meeting also helped me to understand how such problems are
analyzed and resolved in the Turkuaz Project and provided me
with insights into approaches to problem solving in real
enterprise systems.

● Day 9 , 14.07.2025 - Advanced SQL Stored Procedure Training
On the ninth day of my internship, I began the morning with the daily Team
Armageddon meeting at 09:00 once again. After the daily, I continued with SQL Stored
Procedure (SP) training in the same format as the previous day. In this training, I saw how
complex queries were structured, how tables were joined, and how indexes were used to aid
in performance enhancement for query usage. The trainer provided execution plans of
queries and best practices for database optimization and the Turkuaz Project. These
hands-on observations were universally helpful for contextualizing how SP structures are
integrated into the financial module and how the scalability of unlimited data usage is
permissible.

● Day 10 , 15.07.2025 - SQL Training & Interview Question Practice
On Day 10 of my internship, I kicked off the day with the daily meeting of Team Armageddon,
a recurring meeting in which members review tasks and overall priorities. After the daily, a
SQL training session was scheduled for all the engineering interns. The session focused on
the query structure, different ways to optimize efficiency, and hands-on database activities
(see Figure 21). The rest of the day was spent discussing and solving interview questions
from companies, giving us some good exposure to approaches for solving real problems, and
a good heads-up for technical assessments in the future (see Figure 22).

● Day 11 , 18.07.2025 - Debugging and Log Reading Training Session
I participated in a training session on log reading and troubleshooting as part of my
internship. This session demonstrated a live example in Visual Studio showing how data
returned from an SQL reader is read, logging, using breakpoints, and stepping into methods.
The session was very helpful in providing practical training for tracking code flow and getting
the right information from the logs.

● Day 12 , 19.07.2025 - Day 13 , 20.07.2025 - Debugging and Fixing Missing
Mail Parameter in E-Invoice Creation
During this two days, I was debugging an issue with the mail parameter of the
e-invoice creation process. The challenge was that if mail send parameter was missing, the
system would not continue the e-invoice flow, meaning the record would not be created as
an actual e-invoice.
I debugged the code and found out that after the missing parameter was found, the
subsequent e-invoice methods were not getting executed. I adjusted the implementation so
that if the mail parameter was missing, at least some methods invoked for e-invoice creation
would run. This meant the record would be created and categorized correctly as an e-invoice,
regardless of whether the mail was sent.
This task allowed me to improve my debugging skills, including detecting missing
logic in workflows that perform business-critical processes and repairing that logic, as well as
giving me a sense of how to better handle optional parameters without affecting the core
functionality of enterprise systems.

● Day 14 , 21.07.2025 - Day 15 , 22.07.2025 - Service Transformation of
Accounting Module
Conceptual Representation
Over the course of the two days, I contributed to the
service transformation of the Accounting module.
Previously, certain functions were only accessible by
using a DLL library. I assisted with reviewing the existing
structure and contributing several methods into a new
service-oriented architecture, to make the methods
more flexible and scalable. In addition to doing this
technical work, I participated in a meeting about the
service transformation process, where they discussed
sharing objectives, integration steps, and next steps.
This experience allowed me to gain practical experience in service-oriented
architecture, as well as the collaborative process of changing business logic into
modern services.

● Day 16 , 25.07.2025 - Sprint Ceremonies – Review, Retrospective, and
Planning
On this particular day, I participated in the sprint ceremonies that occur
bi-weekly. During the Sprint Review we had a review of what has been
completed in the prior sprint and reflections on the prior sprint as well. During
the Sprint Retrospective, we reflected on strengths and challenges, and
collaborated on possible improvements to the team mindset and processes. The
Sprint Planning included the prioritization of the backlog, setting of goals,
assignment of role, and discussion of possible risks. Finally, a Reporting Session
to check documentation and check in with our stakeholders occurred. These
ceremonies provided insight into agile practices for progress, reflection, and
continuous improvement.

● Day 17 , 26.07.2025 - Parameters, User Authorization, and User Messages in
Turkuaz
On this day, I attended a one-day training session titled, “Parameters, User Authorization,
and User Messages in Turkuaz.” The session specifically discussed how the various
authorization rules are defined and maintained within the system. I learned the process of
creating and linking parameters to the system process, so they can only be used by users
authorized to do so.
Furthermore, the training provided instruction on how user credentials are stored in the
database tables, how page and process authorizations are defined, and how these are tied
into the application flow. We looked at practical examples using SQL scripts, for example,
adding new credentials into the tbl_sec_credential table t and associated those with the
process related, etc.
Another detail covered during the training was user messages, which display and provide
feedback to the end-users while they are using the system. When the parameters,
authorization logic, and user messages were combined, it provided some understanding of
how the Turkuaz platform maintains security and usability.

● Day 18 , 27.07.2025 - Day 19 , 28.07.2025 - Default “Dahili Fatura” Selection
– Development Phase
During these two days, I focused on the development activities associated with the default
selection of “Dahili Fatura” for D-Charge in the invoice acceptance process. My job was to
guarantee the system automatically selects “Dahili Fatura” anytime a user applies the
D-Charge, without requiring them to make a selection. I started with an investigation of the
code structure and how default values were already being enacted in the workflow. Once I
had a firm sense of the relevant locations, I proceeded towards adapting the logic so that the
rule would always apply.
This part of the activity involved lots of debugging as I had to be sure the changes I made did
not impact other costs related to invoices. At the same time, I tested different scenarios to
confirm the automatic selection happened successfully and the workflow was steady. It was
great two days of practice code and putting business logic directly into the code, dealing with
conditional flows, and double-checking to confirm my changes were successful.

● Day 20 , 29.07.2025 - Default “Dahili Fatura” Selection – Finalization with
Analyst Review
On the final day, I worked with the business analyst to review the assignment output and
identified that the issue was caused by mismatched VKID values between pre-production
and production, which disrupted the invoice acceptance process. Once resolved, we verified
that the workflow was functioning as expected. To complete the fix, I initiated a pull request,
which was reviewed and approved by my leads, and then deployed to production. This task
allowed me to gain valuable experience in debugging, collaborating with analysts,
performing formal code reviews, and executing production deployments.
