    "content": "As part of my work placement at PERSU SUNİ DERİ, I was engaged in any of the many\ncomponents comprising production planning and control for the good for the company,\nPERSU Suni Deri. PERSU PRACTICES , COVERS it pertains to the production of artificial leather\nwhich involves a composition of available resources, materials and time to create a production\ncycle efficiently. The bulk of engineering activity in the company includes resource\ndistribution, constructing a production plan, inventory control and design improvement to\nfulfill customer needs while upholding top quality products and services.\nIn the course of the internship, I worked hand in hand with one business engineer, with his\nassistance and supervision I performed production planning and controls. It was about the\ntime when I took the main functions to help create the outlines of the production schedule,\nassess stock, optimize working processes, and organize efficient production of goods. I,\nnevertheless, participated in data collection and analysis of production processes, which\nincluded identifying potential areas of improvement. Also, I assisted in quality assurance\nactivities for artificial leather products produced by the firm in order for the products to meet\ndesired quality.\nBefore I embarked on the internship, I believed I would get hands-on experience in practical\napplication of the knowledge gained in the course units in Manufacturing Systems, Operations\nResearch, and Operations and Facilities Design. To get an idea, I was also looking to see how\nproduction planning is done in the real manufacturing space. The results of the internship in\nthe real world were even better than I had anticipated. Not only did I acquire the knowledge\nin the different technical aspects of production planning but I also built great problem-solving\ncapabilities and know how to work effectively in cross-disciplinary teams.\nAs I have mentioned earlier, this experience helped me to understand production\nmanagement in practice. I was able to effectively use the knowledge of the ‘Probability and\nStatistics’ course in order to track production processes and propose changes to make them\nmore effective. Furthermore, my rapport and presentation skills developed from Technical\nReport Writing, enabled me to document and present my work to the superiors effectively.\nAll in all, this internship enabled me to make use of the classroom knowledge in practice and\nthis way prepared me for industrial engineering and production management careers in the\nfuture.",
