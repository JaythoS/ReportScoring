My\nmain activities included conducting market research, creating competitor analysis reports\nand developing performance marketing strategies. In particular, I carried out studies on\ncustomer segmentation and needs analysis. In addition, I evaluated the impact of marketing\nstrategies using data analysis and examined the background of successful projects. During\nmy internship, I had the opportunity to develop my teamwork and communication skills.\nBefore my internship, I expected to gain practical experience in engineering applications and\nsales-marketing processes. The realized results exceeded my expectations; I had the chance\nto contribute to real-life projects by experiencing team dynamics and collaboration. This\nprocess helped me improve myself in both engineering and marketing.\nDuring my internship, I learned the importance of data analysis, customer-centric thinking,\nand effective communication skills. I also realized how critical team collaboration and\neffective communication in projects are to success. This experience provided an important\nfoundation for me to become a more well-rounded professional in engineering and\nmarketing. What I learned will guide me in my future career and professional development.\n2",

    "feedback": "Özet bölümü şirketin faaliyetlerini, stajyerin görevlerini, beklentileri ve sonuçları ile öğrenilenleri içermektedir. Şirket ve staj faaliyetleri hakkında bazı spesifik detaylar bulunmaktadır (pazar araştırması, müşteri segmentasyonu vb.). Ancak, beklentiler ve sonuçlar arasındaki sentez zayıf kalmaktadır. Öğrenilenler de belirtilmiş ancak daha derinlemesine bir analiz yapılmamıştır. Bu nedenle puan 60 olarak belirlenmiştir."
