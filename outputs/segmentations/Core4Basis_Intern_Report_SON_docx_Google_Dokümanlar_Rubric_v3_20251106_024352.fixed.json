The company provides SAP system installation, upgrade, performance\noptimization, security, backup, and cloud integration services. Its main goal is to assume\nresponsibility for customers' key infrastructures with best-in-class performance and\nreliability.\nDuring my internship, I was a very active member of the daily business processes of\nthe SAP Basis team. I learned checking the systems with the help of SAP GUI, preparing daily\nand weekly reports, and performing backup controls and dump analyses. I also performed\nuser and authorization procedures. Besides that, I prepared weekly system status reports for\ndifferent clients, which included reading system logs, RFC connections, disk space usage,\nmemory space usage, and other important parameters.\nA significant amount of my internship was devoted to being involved in the SAP\nHANA patching process. Under the guidance of my supervisor, I performed full system\nbackups, downloaded the relevant .SAR files from SAP Support Portal, and uploaded them to\nthe respective directories. I powered down the system safely via SAP MMC and initiated the\nupdate process through the hdblcm tool. I learned that careful planning, backup, and check\nsteps are so critical in system updates.\nMoreover, I was taught SAP service management on the SUSE Linux and Windows\nServer platforms by my supervisor. I learned to use terminal commands (df -h, top, ps -ef,\nstartsap, stopsap) and to work with directories. On the Windows platform, I was trained to\nstart and stop instances using SAP Management Console (SAP MMC) and to effectively\nmanage services.\nBefore the internship, my main goal was to learn more about SAP Basis\ninfrastructure and become familiar with the actual systems. This internship exceeded my\nexpectation. I learned the importance of regular system checks, proper documentation, and\ncollaboration in SAP system maintenance. In addition, I obtained experience which SAP Basis\nrequires as much technical knowledge as taking a high level of responsibility. This internship\nassisted me in achieving technical skills and professional working ethics.\n2\n\nC",

The largest challenge for the industry is keeping up with technologies that are\nconstantly evolving while keeping the availability of the system high.\nOver the next 5–10 years, SAP Basis processes will be dramatically changed by\ndevelopments in artificial intelligence, big data analytics, cloud technology, and the Internet\nof Things (IoT). Automated monitoring tools, machine learning–driven performance\nimprovement, and cloud SAP solutions will become mainstream. SAP Basis engineers will\ntherefore have to keep learning and adjusting to emerging technologies.\n8\n\nA ) Impact\nMy internship experience at Core4Basis gave me valuable insights into how SAP Basis\nsolutions could contribute significantly to global, economic, environmental, and societal\ncontributions. SAP systems constitute a significant component of digital infrastructure of\ncompanies around the world. They are used in managing the core business processes like\nfinance, logistics, manufacturing, and human resources. The work I performed and\nobserved—e.g., daily system monitoring, backup management, log scanning, and software\npatching—are technical and plain-looking tasks, but ones with extremely important\nconsequences when viewed as part of a bigger picture.\n- Global Impact:\nSAP Basis solutions enable companies with a global presence to function flawlessly\nworldwide. Stable ERP systems ensure that supply chains, financial transactions, and data\nexchange across geographical regions occur without disruption. If an ERP system of massive\nscale fails, the consequence will be felt across the globe, resulting in delays in production,\nshipping, or financial processes in various markets. The efforts of SAP Basis engineers,\nincluding routine monitoring and patching, deliberately prevent such interference and\nenable business continuity globally. Such reliability is required in today's globalized world\neconomy in businesses that manage cross-border businesses and trade.\n- Economic Impact :\nERP systems have a direct effect on the economic efficiency and competitiveness of\norganizations. System downtime will lead to colossal financial loss, production delays, and\neven damage to reputation. SAP Basis engineers minimize the risk of operation by\nconducting operations such as system checks, database backups, and software updates in\ntime. This enhances productivity, saves costs, and gives companies the potential to make\ninformed data-based decisions. The reports that we have prepared during our internship\nassisted in decision-making by providing real system health and performance data. Marginal\nimprovements in system efficiency in large business organizations make a huge difference in\ncost and enhanced resource utilization, which in the end contributes to economic growth.\n- Environmental Impact:\nSAP systems also help promote environmentally friendly business practices. ERP systems\nintegrated give companies the capacity to plan their logistics, production, and resource\nplanning in a more efficient manner that can reduce energy usage and waste. Cloud-based\nSAP solutions, which are popular with companies, reduce energy usage through aggregated\ninfrastructure and shared resources. Through activities such as HANA patching and system\ntuning, I acquired knowledge on how updates and performance improvements maintain\nsystems with less usage but are yet more efficient, indirectly reducing the environmental\nfootprint of IT operations.\n9\n\n- Societal Impact:\nError-free ERP systems guarantee that societal well-being is facilitated by industries providing\nbasic services. Fields such as healthcare, banking, transportation, and government\nadministration rely on secure and stable systems in order to offer services to millions of\npeople. SAP Basis engin",

Beyond this, security of data and confidentiality—a key part of SAP Basis—is a\nmajor social matter nowadays in the digital age. Through performing user management,\nauthorization, and audit reporting operations, I understood how the engineers protect\nsensitive data and maintain legal and ethical compliance.\nIn short, the engineering activities that I observed throughout my internship—system\nmonitoring, backup administration, log analysis, and patching—are technical in nature. They\nhave extensive impacts on global trade, economic efficiency, environmental sustainability,\nand public trust in computer systems. With new technologies such as artificial intelligence,\nbig data analysis, and cloud computing defining the future, SAP Basis engineers will be asked\nto implement these solutions even more responsibly.

Daily Activities\n● Day 1 , 10.06.2025 - Installation and download\nI met my supervisors and my teammates at the office and we talked about SAP Basis\nPrinciples.\nFirstly, I installed Microsoft Office 365 Programs, with all the meetings and\ndocuments around here.\nAfter that I received S-User ID and Password for SAP Me SubPortal from my\nsupervisor and I logged into the system.\nFigure 1 : Me SAP Portal\nAfterall i installed FortiClient VPN to access the customer's system.\nAt the beginning I had a problem which was about Name access requirements. I was trying\non the FortiClient 7.4 version on my Mac computer but Name was required so I checked\nFortiClient Support. Probably my pc didn't support the 7.4 version and I installed the 7.2\nversion again.\nFigure 2 : FortiClient VPN\n13\n\nThan, I should have downloaded SAP GUI, and i installed JAVA 8 SE because SAP\nGUI7.50rev1 only accessible at JAVA8. After, I had a problem that the GUI didn't reach my\nJava and I googled it. My problem was solved by downloading the SAP GUI 7.70 version.\nFigure 3 : SAP GUI for Java Installation\nFigure 4 : Terminal Screen with Java Version\nFigure 5 : SAP GUI\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n14\n\n● Day 2 , 11.06.2025 - SAP Structures and SAP GUI\nI learned about the three-tier architecture of the SAP system: Presentation Layer,\nApplication Layer, and Database Layer. The users access the system through SAP GUI, which is\ncommunicated with one or more application servers using a message server. The application\nservers, in return, communicate with the database layer.I also checked SAP GUI logon pad,\nwhere different system entries (clients) are saved. I saw that each entry has a system ID,\ninstance, and connection.\nFigure 5 : SAP System Architecture (Three-Tier Structure)\nFigure 6 : HANA Database Access via Command Line\nFigure 7: SAP GUI Logon Pad with System Entries\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n15\n\n● Day 3 , 12.06.2025 - Weekly Periodic Analysis Reporting Description\nI reviewed the weekly periodic analysis report used in the SAP system. The report\nincluded technical checks such as weekly backup control, performance monitoring, dump\nanalysis, system logs, and disk usage. I observed how data was entered on a daily basis into\nthe Excel table and how detailed checks were organized under specific tabs (e.g., Backup\nOverview, Database Disk). The data was retrieved from the SAP system using SAP GUI. By\nreading this report, I learned how SAP works day to day.\nFigure 8 : Periodic Analysis Reporting\nFigure 9 : Large Tables for Periodic Analysis Reporting\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n16\n\n● Day 4 , 13.06.2025 - Audit Reporting Description\nI worked with an Excel worksheet for tracking audit and authorization requests in the\nSAP system. It addressed key control points such as active user and deleted user lists, admin\nauthorizations (SAP_ALL & SAP_NEW), critical authorizations, system parameters\n(RSPARAM), and profile monitoring. Each request was included along with the corresponding\nSAP report name and its status, overwhelmingly set to \"Requested,\" with comments\nreferencing other sheets.
