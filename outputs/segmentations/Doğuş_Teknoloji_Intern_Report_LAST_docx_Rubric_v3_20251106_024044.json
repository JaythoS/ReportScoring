Its main mission is to digitalize the business processes of group\ncompanies, increase efficiency, and provide centralized management of all operations\nthrough modern software solutions. One of the company’s largest initiatives in this direction\nis the Turkuaz Project.\nThe Turkuaz Project integrates various business domains such as vehicles, spare parts,\nprocurement, customer relations, import–export, training, and finance under a single\ncorporate software platform. Its primary goal is to unify different units, digitalize workflows\nend-to-end, and enhance transparency and efficiency across the organization.\nDuring my internship, my primary area of work was in the Finance Module, which includes\ncore capabilities, such as invoice handling, payments and collections, exchange rate\nvariances, integration to accounting, additional budget requests, approval workflows, and\nreporting. In joining the Finance team, I was involved in software development, debugging,\ntesting, and module integration.\nThrough trainings at Turkuaz Academy, I had gained knowledge on the architecture of the\nproject, database schema design, and coding standard in good detail. I practiced Agile/Scrum\npractices such as daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and retrospectives from which I had gained\nknowledge on how large projects are organized and executed. I also gained hands-on\nknowledge on tools like Visual Studio, Git Extensions, and MS SQL Management Studio.\nThe internship provided me with technical expertise in debugging and SQL stored procedures\nand clean code principles (SOLID Principles) and service-oriented architecture (SOA). The\nexperience provided me with essential knowledge about working with teams and effective\ncommunication while handling real-world responsibilities in a commercial software\ndevelopment project.\nThe internship at Dogus Teknoloji provided me with technical knowledge while teaching me\nprofessional responsibility and team collaboration and showing me how financial operations\ntransform into digital systems within corporate structures.",

I looked at the code and made the required\nchanges where the correct default selection was being triggered for D-Charge. During this\ntask, I also had an issue due to the pre-production environment not having the institution's\nreal VKN, and I was able to eventually get it resolved by consulting with the analysts and\nplanning a test data update.\n● Connection to Major Studies:\nThis task readily connects to courses on enterprise application development and\ndatabase-driven systems, where customizing and engineering requirements are commonly\npracticed.\n● Interesting and Challenging Aspects:\nIt was interesting to see how a small change to a default value can have an impact on user\nefficiency.

More\nspecifically, within the D-Charge institution, when users accept invoices, the field “İşlem\nYapılacak Cari Hesap Ürünü” (Account Product) defaults to “Y.İÇİ SATICI”, which is a problem.\nThe incorrect default adds a few unnecessary steps for users, in addition to creating\nconfusion because business logic should default to “Dahili Fatura”.\nI was tasked with determining where the existing code used to default this field, reviewing\nexisting code, and updating it to default to \"Dahili Fatura” within D-Charge.\n11\n\n● The development process included:\n- Reviewing the current implementation and pinpointing the section where\nthe default values were set.\n- Revamping the logic to check for the institution (D-Charge) conditionally.\n- Assigning the appropriate default (\"Dahili Fatura\") accordingly.\n- Corresponded with the business analysts to clarify testing matter: the real\nD-Charge’s VKN (Tax ID) in pre-production was not present so a full testing\ncould not be completed.\n● Performance Indicators / Metrics:\nVarious aspects of performance are worth noting:\n- User efficiency: The new default lessened the number of clicks manually\nrequired by users for each invoice acceptance. Previously, users had to\nmanually adjust the field, whereas now it is automatically correct.\n- Reduction of errors: The selection of incorrect options (e.g. selecting \"Y.İÇİ\nSATICI\" instead of \"Dahili faturası\") has been removed, reducing the\npotential for mismatches with accounting.\n- Consistency of the system: The solution brought D-Charge's behavior inline\nwith that of DOS institution, ensuring consistency to those across different\ninstitutions.\n- Reliability of testing: The lack of real VKN in pre-production had been a\nblocker. Working with analysts brought better attention to the quality of the\nenvironments data.\n12\n\n● Problematic Issues Identified:\n- Gap of the Testing Environment: The core of the issue was the lack of\nD-Charge's actual VKN in the pre-production database. This made it\nimpossible for developers to thoroughly assess functionality through testing.\nThe extend of this problem pointed to a larger issue of keeping synchronized\nand accurate test data across environments for reproducible testing.\n- Manual Data Dependency: This system relied on user correction prior to the\nchange implementation, which was inaccurate and not a good use of time.\nThis dependency leads to time ineffectiveness in the invoicing process.\n- Business Impact Risk: The scenario of defaulting into a wrong account\nproduct could lead to accounting errors, financial discrepancies, and user\ndissatisfaction for customers\nEngineering Relevance:\nThis activity reflects five core Computer Engineering practices.\n- Requirements engineering (decoding the analyst's request),\n- Customizing software in enterprise systems,\n- Debugging and dealing with environment-specific issues,\n- Collaborative problem solving with analysts.\n13",

The functional requirement was to have the field “İşlem Yapılacak\nCari Hesap Ürünü” default to “Dahili Fatura” inside the D-Charge facility. During the process\nof developing the functionality, I encountered a significant issue from an engineering\nstandpoint: the real D-Charge VKN (Tax Identifier) was not present in the pre-production\nenvironment, so I could not fully test the new functionality.\nIn some ways, this highlighted a larger problem beyond the specific requirement: the\nabsence of synchronized and realistic test data across environments.\n● Problem Definition:\nMain Problem : The pre-production environment contains D-Charge's false VKN allowing for\nonly limited testing which carries risk when deploying in the production environment.\nEngineering Connection: This is not unusual in a large software project where the test\nenvironment lacks the completeness or accuracy of production data.\n● Analysis of the Problem:\nCurrent State: Developers used incomplete or outdated test data which didn't allow for\nreliable preproduction validations.\nConsequences:\n* Increased likelihood of finding problems only after the deployment.\n* Tedious debugging cycles, and more expensive fix costs in production.\n* Dependence on analysts to manually check for missing data.\nMetrics:\n* Number of incomplete or failed tests cases owing to VKN requirement.\n* History and time with the analysts, coordinating data clarifications.\n* The higher likelihood of a users unhappiness or financial discrepancies from deploying a\nwrong default to production.\n● Proposed Solution:\nTo address this issue, I worked with analysts to initiate the request for the insertion of the\nproper D-Charge VKN in pre-production. In the more long-term, outside of this interim\nsolution, there is a possible option of starting to utilize Test Data Management (TDM)\napproaches, with potential options being:\n- Keeping data sets in sync, between prod and pre-prod.\n- Using dummy or de-identified production data to test.\n14\n\n- Updating configurations, for environments to ensure significant identifiers\n(e.g. VKNs) are always in the test database.\n● Literature Survey and References:\nThe issue of unrepresentative test data is common in enterprise systems (IBM, Test Data\nManagement Best Practices, 2022).\nOp-eds and books introducing \"shift-left testing\" and continuous integration pipelines stress\nhow reliable and automated testing can only be achieved with effective test environments.\nResearch in the academic literature (e.g., IEEE Software, 2021) suggests that mocking and\nsynthetic data generation can help increase reliability without having to deal with data\nprivacy.\n● Expected Benefits of the Solution:\n- Improved Testing Reliability: Assures essential business rules (such as defaulting to\n“Dahili Fatura”) will be validated pre-production.\n- Reduced Deployment Risks: Fewer production errors and smoother go-livess\n- Enhanced Developer Productivity: Less reliance on analysts for missing data.\n- Business Continuity: Correct defaults ensure financial data is in sync and lessen the\nnumber of manual interactions by users.\n● Conclusion:\nThis initiative not only addressed the particular concern of missing VKN in D-Charge\npre-production testing, but also illuminated the need for more well-managed testing data in\nenterprise software engineering in the future. Determining which short-term fixes can be\ncombined with best practices is an important goal for improving the reliability of enterprise\nsystems.\n15",

Conclusions\nDuring my internship at Dogus Teknoloji, I had a chance to be part of the Finance Module of\nthe Turkuaz Project, which is one of the largest digital transformation projects of Dogus\nGroup. During this time, I realized how enterprise scale software systems are designed,\ndeveloped, tested, and deployed in real corporate settings.\nBy attending to many different tasks—debugging issues in the e-invoicing process,\ncontributing to the service transformation of accounting processes, implementing default\nvalue logic in invoice approval, and training on SQL stored procedures, as well as SOLID\nprinciples—I greatly developed my technical skills. These tasks made me realize the\nimportance of rigor, scalability, and high-quality coding standards in enterprise systems.\nAdditionally, I formalised understanding of the project’s architecture, database design, and\ndata coding standards from attending trainings in the Turkuaz Academy. Also, attending Agile\nstrategies—daily standups, sprint planning, reviews, and retrospectives—enabled me to\nobserve how teamwork, communication, and planning can push progress on large system\nimplementations.\nI realized that, as a professional, there was more to my responsibility than my technical\ncapability. Every change I made to the code was to be documented, reviewed, and tested\nprecisely to support the authenticity of the system and continuity of business. However,\nethical values such as confidentiality, accountability, and fairness could not just go through\nthe workflows shaping a professional atmosphere where everyone saw technical and ethical\nas equally valuable.\nIn summary, I am able to consider my internship at Dogus Teknoloji to be a comprehensive\npositive experience in which I improved my understanding of enterprise software\ndevelopment, improved my problem-solving and debugging capabilities, and had the\nexperience of being part of Agile based teams in the corporate workplace. But most\nimportantly, the experience demonstrated to me that being a computer engineer is so much\nmore than solving problems - it is having responsibilities, working collaboratively, and helping\nto guide an entire organization through digital transformation.\n16",

During my\ninternship I worked on things like debugging, transforming services, developing SQL\nstatements, and automating financial processes. So, although my scope did not extend to\nanything much larger than each of those and what was happening in the background, I found\nthese insignificant \"technical\" tasks to have considerable implications of larger outcomes.\n● Global Impact:\nThe Turkuaz Project has been developed as a digital backbone for the Dogus Group,\nwhich is an international multi-sector entity. It is reliable and integrated systems that\nenable financial transactions, logistics' coordination, and reporting between business\nunits. Even small performance enhancements or reductions of errors in systems all\ncontribute to cross-border operations functioning smoothly.\n● Economic Impact:\nFinancial correctness and efficiency are very essential for the success of any\norganization. I witnessed, through work such as automating invoice acceptance\ndefaults or debugging e-invoice background processes, how technical improvements\ncan lessen manual errors, save time, and adhere to financial standards. All these\nimprovements lead to cost efficiency and promote the company's competitiveness.\n● Environmental Impact:\nTurkuaz's digitalization of business processes reduces paper workloads and waste of\nresources. Having focused financial operations and reporting allows companies to\nmake better plans for efficient resource allocation as well as reduced inefficiencies.\nAlongside this, Dogus Teknoloji's adoption of cloud solutions and modern\narchitectures, allows for more energy efficient IT operations.\n● Societal Impact:\nWhen financial and operational systems operate correctly, they indirectly serve the\npublic good by providing services to millions of people through industries such as\nautomotive, retail, and finance. Secure and well-managed data processes also\nprotect sensitive information, demonstrating the increasing importance of digital\ntrust within the fabric of our society.\nTo sum up, even if my technical contributions were insignificant in comparison to the overall\nTurkuaz Project, they provided a degree of insights in enterprise software development due\nto its implications for broader corporate operations, business sustainability, economic\nefficiencies, the environment, and confidence in technology at a societal level.\n17",

The team developed its work based on Agile/Scrum\nmethodology from the beginning, which allowed for development items to be prioritized,\nwork assigned and shared, and progress monitored continuously.\nMy daily routine often began with daily meetings, where each member updated the team\nabout their tasks and blockers. I also participated in sprint planning, reviews, and\nretrospectives, which showed me how feedback, reflection, and forward planning were\nessential for continuous improvement.\nAs an intern, I contributed to the project with the support of my buddy and senior\ndevelopers who assisted me with debugging, SQL training, and development tasks, teaching\nme not only technical skills, but also the communication and collaboration aspects of being\nin a successful working environment.\nWe used tools such as Microsoft Teams, Git Extensions, and Visual Studio, for sharing\nprogress, review of code and to communicate and coordinate development team activities\nwhich essentially ensured that even minor issues were addressed immediately and team\nmembers supported each other.\nI discovered that teamwork was more than breaking apart tasks. It consisted of knowledge\nsharing, jointly pursuing solutions to problems, as well as group accountability.

While the\nstructured training I received (mainly from Turkuaz Academy) gave me the fundamental\ntheoretical foundations for software architecture, database design, and coding principles, I\nlearned most of my refinements and knowledge through personal study.\nFor example, when I was testing and revising the missing mail parameter in the e-invoice\nprocess or changing the first/default value selection for the invoice acceptance workflow, I\nwas required to read through documentation, review existing code, and try out different\nsolutions. This experience taught me how to investigate a problem by myself and implement\nthe solution thoroughly.\nI further fortified my knowledge of SQL stored procedures, the SOLID principles, and\nservice-oriented architecture by not just learning the training material, but also\nindependently studying additional developer forums, and official documentation, and coding\nbest practices in those areas of study. This allowed me to continue to figure out not just what\nto do, but why those practices matter in enterprise-scale systems.\n18\n\nMoreover, I made it a habit to record comprehensive personal notes, training applications,\nand public training and application meetings when I took the course of code learning. The\nnotes served as a personal reference point I could use to return to complex concepts, and\nthey ultimately morphed into a learning journal that increased my learning rate.\nDuring this internship, I enhanced my abilities to learn independently, adapt to new\ntechnologies, and take charge of my own development. I now realize that in the IT\nindustry—an industry where frameworks, tools, and practices are always\nchanging—engineers need to become comfortable with self-directed learning as a skill that\nlasts a lifetime to continue to be effective and relevant.",

Daily Activities\n● Day 1 , 04.07.2025 - Installation and Environment Setup\nOn the first day of my internship, I accomplished the necessary installations and\nenvironment setups for the Turkuaz Project.\n- I began by navigating to the Azure Portal and verifying project connections (see\nFigure 1).\n- Next, I established a connection to the company environment via the VDI (Remote\nDesktop) (see Figure 2).\n- Git was installed for version control, and I was able to successfully clone the\nrepositories using Git Extensions (see Figure 3).\n- Visual Studio was established as the development environment and I opened the\nproject files to conduct a first pass of review (see Figure 4).\n- Lastly, I tested the database connections and executed sample queries in MS SQL\nManagement Studio to ensure I had proper access (see Figure 5).\nFigure 1 : Azure Portal\nFigure 2 : VDI (Remote Desktop)\n20\n\nFigure 3 : Git Extensions\nFigure 4 : Visual Studio\nFigure 5 : MS SQL Management Studio\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n21\n\n● Day 2 , 05.07.2025 - Turkuaz Project Introduction & Finance Module\nOn the second day of my internship, I began the morning with the Team\nArmageddon daily meeting at 09:00. Following the daily meeting, I had my one-on-one with\nmy buddy, who provided an overview of the purpose and scope of the Turkuaz Project.\nThe Turkuaz Project is an integrated corporate software platform developed for\nDogus Group. The Turkuaz Project is comprised of multiple modules, including Vehicle, Parts,\nProcurement, Customer Relations, Import-Export, Approval, Training, and Finance. The\npurpose of the project is to consolidate the different business units under one umbrella,\ndigitalize the process, increase efficiency, and centralize management.\nMy buddy also described the roles of the Finance team, of which I am a member.\nThe Finance module performs many functions including, invoice functions, payments and\ncollections, foreign exchange differences purchase, accounting, extra budget approvals,\ndocumentation, and financial reports. These functions allow all financial functions to be\nsystematically and seamlessly handled in the system.\nThe module centralizes processes such as invoice tracking, payment processing,\nforeign exchange rate difference, and financial reports to ensure accuracy and efficiency. As a\nFinance team member, my job is to manage the software side of these processes and\nsupport the digitalization of the finance functions for the Turkuaz Project.\nFigure 6 : Team Armageddon – Daily meeting schedule at 09:00\nFigure 7 : Turkuaz Project – Finance module with core functions such as\nInvoice, Payments, Accounting, and Reporting\n22\n\nFigure 8 :Turkuaz Project – Creating a purchase request within the Finance\nmodule (budget and approval workflow)\nFigure 9 :Turkuaz Project – Payment selection options in the Finance module\n(e.g., personnel payments, vehicle transactions, taxes, insurance)\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n23\n\n● Day 3 , 06.07.2025 - Turkuaz Academy Training (Architecture – Part 1)\nAfter the daily meeting, I signed into Dogus Group SharePoint to access the Turkuaz\nAcademy training materials. These trainings were already prepared for interns, and I expect\nthem to take me around two weeks to complete. At the end, I am supposed to have a\nthorough understanding of the Turkuaz Project's structure and architecture.\nToday, I focused on the Turkuaz Software Architecture and Database Architecture\ntraining and, because I took meticulous notes while progressing through, I made it through at\nleast half of the session. The training provided useful insight into the project's architectural\ndesign, database structure, and technical architecture overall.\nFigure 10 : Turkuaz Academy – Accessing training videos via Dogus Group SharePoint\n24\n\n...\nFigure 11 : Personal notes on Turkuaz Flow Architecture in Google Docs\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n25\n\n● Day 4 , 07.07.2025 - Architecture Training Continuation & General\nDevelopment Meeting\nOn Day 4 of my internship, I began at 09:00 by attending the Team Armageddon daily\nmeeting. After the daily, I continued with the Turkuaz Software Architecture and Database\nArchitecture training by moving onto the rest of the session. This portion of the training\nfocused more on practical examples of how business logic and the database were brought\ntogether in the Turkuaz Project (see Figure 12).\nLater in the day, I also attended the general development meeting, which occurs\nonce a month and encompasses all developers on the Turkuaz Project. The development\nmeeting allowed me to see the overall project progress, get updates from all teams, and see\nhow all development is being executed (see Figure 13).\nFigure 12 : Turkuaz Academy – Continuation of Software Architecture &\nDatabase Architecture training\nFigure 13: Monthly general development meeting with all developers\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n26\n\n● Day 5 , 08.07.2025 - Sprint Planning & Git Branch Strategy Training\nOn the fifth day of my internship, I started the morning with the Team\nArmageddon Sprint Planning meeting, led by Levent Taskıran (Dogus\nTeknoloji). During this meeting, the team reviewed the upcoming sprint\ngoals, discussed the tasks to be prioritized, and aligned on\nresponsibilities. This meeting helped me better understand the\nAgile/Scrum process and how the team organizes their work in short\niterations to ensure steady progress.\nLater in the day, I attended a second meeting focused on Accounting\nService Integration, presented by Yusuf Eymen Sezen (My Buddy) in\nwhich the presentation was centered around how accounting processes\nare being accommodated into services based structures with some\nmodularity and scalability perspective of Turkuaz Project. The\npresentation would provide insight on how accounting processes are\ndigitalized and integrated with other parts of the system.\nLater on, I also attended a Turkuaz Git Branch Strategy training, where\nGit and GitExtensions were introduced and demonstrated in front of our group. This\nintroduction enhanced my current understanding of the branching model used in the\nproject, along with how developers collaborate effectively through version-control practices.\nI also took some of my own notes during the training to help me better wrap my head\naround the processes when performing similar tasks (Figure 14).\nFigure 14: Turkuaz Academy – Git Branch Strategy training with GitExtensions\n27\n\nFigure 15: Personal notes on Turkuaz Git Branch Strategy training\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n28\n\n● Day 6 , 11.07.2025 - Day 7 , 12.07.2025 - Sprint Retrospective & SOLID\nPrinciples Training\nThroughout my two-day internship, I started my day with the Team Armageddon daily\nmeeting at 09:00, and then participated in the Sprint Retrospective led by Levent Taskıran. In\nthis retrospective, the team reflected on the achievements and challenges from the previous\nsprint and set actions to improve for this next sprint, which was a great chance to see how\nAgile methods and retrospectives work within the Turkuaz Project.\nFigure 15 : Team Armageddon Sprint Retrospective and Backlog Review Meeting\nI attended the SOLID Principles and Clean Code curriculum (Figure 16). I started it on Day 6,\ntook notes initially, and completed it on Day 7. The training showed how the SOLID principles\nare applied within the Turkuaz Project through practical coding examples in Visual Studio,\nincluding class structuring and interfaces and refactoring code for readability. I have\ncompleted personal notes (Figure 19) that I can reference to solidify my understanding of\nclean code practices in enterprise-scale projects.\nFigure 16: Turkuaz Academy – SOLID Principles and Clean Code training\n29\n\nFigure 17: Personal notes on SOLID Principles training with Storytelling\nExamples in Google Docs\n30\n\nFigure 18: Personal notes on continuation of storytelling examples and identifying\nlack of SOLID principles\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n31\n\n● Day 8 , 13.07.2025 - SQL Stored Procedure Training & Reflection Problem\nMeeting\nOn the eighth day, I once again started the morning at 09:00AM with the Team Armageddon\ndaily meeting, where the team reviewed ongoing tasks and progress.\nAfter the daily, I attended the training session titled “Turkuaz Trainings - SQL: Stored\nProcedure (SP) Structure” (Figure 19). This training session presented the purpose of stored\nprocedures within the Turkuaz Project, explaining that SP's can standardize database tasks,\nperformance improvement and modularity across the system.\nThere were live demos in Visual Studio, going through a SP creation, including usage of\nparameters, error handling and execution flow. This training gave me more insight to the SQL\nlayer of Turkuaz and how structured coding practices are utilized in its database structure.\nFigure 19: Training session on SQL Stored Procedure (SP) structure in the\nTurkuaz Project\nOn the same day, I attended a meeting led by Yusuf Eymen Sezen\non the topic \"Yansıtma Problemi\" (Reflection Problem), which\nfocused on some technical issues surrounding reflection and the\nimpact on system performance and accuracy problems. This\nmeeting also helped me to understand how such problems are\nanalyzed and resolved in the Turkuaz Project and provided me\nwith insights into approaches to problem solving in real\nenterprise systems.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n32\n\n● Day 9 , 14.07.2025 - Advanced SQL Stored Procedure Training\nOn the ninth day of my internship, I began the morning with the daily Team\nArmageddon meeting at 09:00 once again. After the daily, I continued with SQL Stored\nProcedure (SP) training in the same format as the previous day. In this training, I saw how\ncomplex queries were structured, how tables were joined, and how indexes were used to aid\nin performance enhancement for query usage. The trainer provided execution plans of\nqueries and best practices for database optimization and the Turkuaz Project. These\nhands-on observations were universally helpful for contextualizing how SP structures are\nintegrated into the financial module and how the scalability of unlimited data usage is\npermissible.\nFigure 20: Advanced SQL Stored Procedure (SP) training session in Turkuaz Project\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n33",

After the daily, a\nSQL training session was scheduled for all the engineering interns. The session focused on\nthe query structure, different ways to optimize efficiency, and hands-on database activities\n(see Figure 21). The rest of the day was spent discussing and solving interview questions\nfrom companies, giving us some good exposure to approaches for solving real problems, and\na good heads-up for technical assessments in the future (see Figure 22).\nFigure 21 : Basic SQL training session using DB Fiddle environment\nFigure 22 : Interview-style SQL question (Amazon case study)\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n34\n\n● Day 11 , 18.07.2025 - Debugging and Log Reading Training Session\nI participated in a training session on log reading and troubleshooting as part of my\ninternship. This session demonstrated a live example in Visual Studio showing how data\nreturned from an SQL reader is read, logging, using breakpoints, and stepping into methods.\nThe session was very helpful in providing practical training for tracking code flow and getting\nthe right information from the logs.\nFigure 23 : Debugging and Log Reading Training Session in Visual Studio\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n35\n\n● Day 12 , 19.07.2025 - Day 13 , 20.07.2025 - Debugging and Fixing Missing\nMail Parameter in E-Invoice Creation\nDuring this two days, I was debugging an issue with the mail parameter of the\ne-invoice creation process. The challenge was that if mail send parameter was missing, the\nsystem would not continue the e-invoice flow, meaning the record would not be created as\nan actual e-invoice.\nI debugged the code and found out that after the missing parameter was found, the\nsubsequent e-invoice methods were not getting executed. I adjusted the implementation so\nthat if the mail parameter was missing, at least some methods invoked for e-invoice creation\nwould run. This meant the record would be created and categorized correctly as an e-invoice,\nregardless of whether the mail was sent.\nThis task allowed me to improve my debugging skills, including detecting missing\nlogic in workflows that perform business-critical processes and repairing that logic, as well as\ngiving me a sense of how to better handle optional parameters without affecting the core\nfunctionality of enterprise systems.\nFigure 24 : Debugging Missing Mail Parameter in E-Invoice Creation Process\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n36\n\n● Day 14 , 21.07.2025 - Day 15 , 22.07.2025 - Service Transformation of\nAccounting Module\nConceptual Representation\nOver the course of the two days, I contributed to the\nservice transformation of the Accounting module.\nPreviously, certain functions were only accessible by\nusing a DLL library. I assisted with reviewing the existing\nstructure and contributing several methods into a new\nservice-oriented architecture, to make the methods\nmore flexible and scalable. In addition to doing this\ntechnical work, I participated in a meeting about the\nservice transformation process, where they discussed\nsharing objectives, integration steps, and next steps.\nThis experience allowed me to gain practical experience in service-oriented\narchitecture, as well as the collaborative process of changing business logic into\nmodern services.\nFigure 25 : Accounting Module – Service Transformation Code Snippet\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n37\n\n● Day 16 , 25.07.2025 - Sprint Ceremonies – Review, Retrospective, and\nPlanning\nOn this particular day, I participated in the sprint ceremonies that occur\nbi-weekly. During the Sprint Review we had a review of what has been\ncompleted in the prior sprint and reflections on the prior sprint as well. During\nthe Sprint Retrospective, we reflected on strengths and challenges, and\ncollaborated on possible improvements to the team mindset and processes. The\nSprint Planning included the prioritization of the backlog, setting of goals,\nassignment of role, and discussion of possible risks. Finally, a Reporting Session\nto check documentation and check in with our stakeholders occurred. These\nceremonies provided insight into agile practices for progress, reflection, and\ncontinuous improvement.\nFigure 26 : Sprint Retrospective\nFigure 26 : Sprint Review, Backolog\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n38\n\n● Day 17 , 26.07.2025 - Parameters, User Authorization, and User Messages in\nTurkuaz\nOn this day, I attended a one-day training session titled, “Parameters, User Authorization,\nand User Messages in Turkuaz.” The session specifically discussed how the various\nauthorization rules are defined and maintained within the system. I learned the process of\ncreating and linking parameters to the system process, so they can only be used by users\nauthorized to do so.\nFurthermore, the training provided instruction on how user credentials are stored in the\ndatabase tables, how page and process authorizations are defined, and how these are tied\ninto the application flow. We looked at practical examples using SQL scripts, for example,\nadding new credentials into the tbl_sec_credential table t and associated those with the\nprocess related, etc.\nAnother detail covered during the training was user messages, which display and provide\nfeedback to the end-users while they are using the system. When the parameters,\nauthorization logic, and user messages were combined, it provided some understanding of\nhow the Turkuaz platform maintains security and usability.\nFigure 27: SQL Scripts and User Authorization Logic Demonstration in Turkuaz\nPlatform Training\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n39\n\n● Day 18 , 27.07.2025 - Day 19 , 28.07.2025 - Default “Dahili Fatura” Selection\n– Development Phase\nDuring these two days, I focused on the development activities associated with the default\nselection of “Dahili Fatura” for D-Charge in the invoice acceptance process. My job was to\nguarantee the system automatically selects “Dahili Fatura” anytime a user applies the\nD-Charge, without requiring them to make a selection. I started with an investigation of the\ncode structure and how default values were already being enacted in the workflow. Once I\nhad a firm sense of the relevant locations, I proceeded towards adapting the logic so that the\nrule would always apply.\nThis part of the activity involved lots of debugging as I had to be sure the changes I made did\nnot impact other costs related to invoices. At the same time, I tested different scenarios to\nconfirm the automatic selection happened successfully and the workflow was steady. It was\ngreat two days of practice code and putting business logic directly into the code, dealing with\nconditional flows, and double-checking to confirm my changes were successful.\n* The source code is not disclosed due to confidentiality restrictions.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n40\n\n● Day 20 , 29.07.2025 - Default “Dahili Fatura” Selection – Finalization with\nAnalyst Review\nOn the final day, I worked with the business analyst to review the assignment output and\nidentified that the issue was caused by mismatched VKID values between pre-production\nand production, which disrupted the invoice acceptance process. Once resolved, we verified\nthat the workflow was functioning as expected. To complete the fix, I initiated a pull request,\nwhich was reviewed and approved by my leads, and then deployed to production. This task\nallowed me to gain valuable experience in debugging, collaborating with analysts,\nperforming formal code reviews, and executing production deployments.\nFigure 27: Pull Request Review and Approval Workflow in Azure DevOps\nFigure 28: Pull Request Deployment Tracking and State Graph in Azure DevOps\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n41",
