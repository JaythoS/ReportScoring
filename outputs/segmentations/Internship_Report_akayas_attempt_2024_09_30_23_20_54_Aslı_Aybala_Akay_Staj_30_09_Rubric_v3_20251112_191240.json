No:82F Emaar İş Merkezi Kat:20/21 Üsküdar\nIstanbul 34700 Turkey\n•Web links: https://www.redbull.com/tr-tr\nInspired by functional drinks used in the Far East, Dietrich Mateschitz founded Red Bull in the\nmid-1980s. He not only brought a new product to market, but also developed a unique\nmarketing concept and launched Red Bull Energy Drink in Austria on April 1, 1987. Thus, a new\nproduct category was born - energy drinks. (Red Bull Energy Drink-Company)\nAccording to the company's website, the first can of Red Bull was sold on April 1, 1987. In 1992,\nthe catchy brand slogan \"Winged\", \"Gives you wings\" was advertised. As of the end of 2023, Red\nBull employs 17,848 people in 177 countries (end of 2022: 15,779 in 175 countries). In 2023,\n12.138 billion cans of Red Bull were sold, a 4.8% increase compared to the previous year. The\ngoal is to exceed this figure in 2024 and increase growth.\nThe company's headquarters is in Austria and in Turkey, it is in Istanbul, but it also has offices in\ncities such as Ankara, Izmir and Bursa.\nIt is the leader in the Energy Drinks category, which is Red Bull's area, and aims to appeal to\nconsumers with its special Edition series and Sugar Free options in addition to its Regular Red\nBull product.\nRed Bull operates in the FMCG sector. FMCG is a product that is sold quickly and at a relatively\nlow cost. Examples include packaged foods, beverages, convenience foods, toiletries, candies,\ncosmetics, over-the-counter medicines, dry goods, and other consumables. Red Bull states its\nclaim with its products that promise energy and flavor to the consumer in its slogan, “Revitalizes\nthe body and mind.”\nIn summary, the basic service that Red Bull provides as a company is to deliver energy drink\nproducts to consumers.\nProduct varieties vary in Turkey and different countries.

Since\nRed Bull products are not produced in Turkey, the optimization and efficiency of the processes\nof shipping, storing and delivering products to customers from the countries where they are\nproduced are critical for the company. In this context, the company aims to continue its\nactivities on innovative technologies. Some of the tasks undertaken in this direction are as\nfollows:\n•To produce projects that will increase efficiency by examining existing processes and\napplications\n• To carry out regular competitor analyses and to make reports in the necessary areas in this\ndirection.\n• To calculate project feasibility\n• To determine the steps to be followed during projects and to share them with the teams to be\ncollaborated with\n• To be prepared for problems that may occur during project development processes Actively\nusing teamwork and communication skills between teams\nInternship Activities:\nDuring my internship, I interpreted many reports, especially those from Nielsen, and prepared\nthem as presentations. At this point, I actively conducted competitor analyses. I analyzed the\nimpact of specific projects implemented such as our campaign periods on our sales regionally\nand product-based. I created customer and month-by-month reports for local chain markets and\nwholesale channels on Excel. I also reflected these reports on dashboards on Excel.\nApart from this, I created and published budget files by collecting invoices and sales amounts\nreceived each month in a single file. At the beginning, I thought my internship would be only\ndata-focused, but I constantly communicated one-on-one with DPMs from 7 regions and every\ncity. This greatly contributed to the development of my communication skills and problem-\nsolving abilities.\nDue to the importance of the responsibilities given to interns within Red Bull, I was able to\ndirectly contact DPMs and heads of different units such as different sales channels and trade\nmarketing and ask my questions. I think this is very valuable and I feel very lucky to have\ninterned in a company that contributed to my development so much.\nKey Takeaways:\nThe most important thing I learned from this internship was that it made me realize that the\nFMCG sector is the sector I want to advance in. I am very excited to work for a brand that has a\npermanent place in the consumer's life and creates brand love.\nIf I have to talk about departments, during this time I had the opportunity to get to know the\nsales department on different channels and the teams that sales sometimes collaborates with,\nsuch as Brand and Trade Marketing. This experience was a milestone for me, but I believe it\nwould be better to try out the Marketing department with different internships I will do in the\nfuture and clarify my long-term career plan in this way.",

In\nthis way, the main goal is to evaluate past performance and create a basis for future sales\nforecasts based on these evaluations. The aim is to determine growth trends, weak and strong\npoints, and thus reach more accurate sales forecasts.\n• Performance Indicators: I used monthly data sets via Univera to analyze historical SKU\nperformance accurately.\n• Data and Analysis: I collected and analyzed SKU-based sales data from previous months.\nBy calculating the monthly performance and growth rates of each SKU, I saw the\nperformance of the products clearly. Accordingly, I listed low and high performing\nproducts.\n• Challenges: It was difficult to work on SKUs with limited data and seasonal variations,\nand to interpret the data correctly for some seasonal products such as editions. It was\nalso necessary to clarify the accuracy of the data in reports from relatively remote\nregions such as the Cyprus region.\n• Advantages: This analysis helps identify key trends, access specific information such as\nwhich SKU is in higher demand regionally, and thus make future forecasts more reliable.\nIn addition, this project helps in better resource allocation in production and marketing\nin the long run.\nThis step of the project helped us gain a clear understanding of SKU trends by analyzing past\nsales data. This allowed us to optimize inventory levels, production and logistics processes more\nefficiently.\nProject 1.2: Monthly Sales Forecasts and Comparison\nThe second step of the project involves collecting monthly sales forecasts for each SKU from the\nfield sales team and comparing these forecasts with actual sales data. The aim is to improve\nforecast accuracy and adjust inventory control plans according to real-time sales performance.\nIn case of significant differences in the forecast indexes at this point, revision requests can be\nmade by discussing with the relevant customers' DPMs.\n• Performance Indicators: In order to measure the consistency between the forecasted\nand actual sales figures, I created index rates separately for each customer by dividing\nthem by each other.\n• Data and Analysis: We expected our DPM and LKAMs to create monthly forecasts using\nhistorical data and market conditions. At this point, I obtained the necessary information\nfrom the forecasting officers in order to make the right analysis in cases where the\nregion/customer had a special story. Then, I compared these forecasts with actual sales\nto evaluate their accuracy and improve future forecasts and shared them with the field.",

The goal is\nto improve trend analysis by facilitating data interpretation for each customer.\n• Performance Indicators: I created a dashboard page based on SKUs to communicate\nyear-by-year sales trends and identify inconsistencies in forecasts, and created separate\ncharts where only the months forecasted were compared to the previous year’s actuals.\n• Data and Analysis: I made the data captured in the previous stages from the past and\npresent more intuitive for my department manager and field managers who performed\nthe forecasts. At this point, I used functions such as slicer, pivot table, charts and VBA in\nExcel. Project 1.1: SKU Based Sales Forecast and Trend Analysis\n• Challenges: It was difficult to simplify the raw data image when visualizing large data\nsuch as the most demanded SKU. For this reason, I aimed to visualize the desired data\nmore clearly by making selections with the slicers I added.\n• Advantages: Graphical analysis allowed faster and more effective decision making,\nallowing customers to adjust their strategies in the coming months accordingly.\nThanks to this step, I learned how graphic and data visualization in sales contribute to a better\nunderstanding of the processes.\nProject 2: Creating a Budget File and Calculating Earned Values\nThis project was created to improve the budget management process of the company's LKA\nsales. Earned value calculations are made by comparing incoming invoices and sales data, and\nthe results are presented to 37 Distribution Partner Managers, 5 Local Key Account Managers\nand the sales director with regular reports.\n• Performance Indicators: Accuracy of the budget file and ensuring invoice-sales\ncompatibility. Finding customers with the correct codes in sales and incoming invoices in\nthe system and correct amounts.\n• Data and Analysis: All incoming invoice data was collected in a single Excel and\ncompared with sales in the system. This data was analyzed with Excel tools such as\nSUMIF, VLOOKUP, PIVOT and earned value was calculated.",

Each DPM and LKAM saw their end-of-\nmonth status and planned their next month more efficiently.\nThis step helped me understand that regular budget tracking in sales leads to healthier\nstrategies in the long run.\nProject 3: Strategy Development Using Nielsen Reports\nThis project aims to analyze regional sales performances using Nielsen reports and create\nstrategy presentations based on these analyses. The aim is to analyze the market share, sales\nvolume, and per-liter product price in each region and make presentations and inferences that\nwill help create strategies to gain competitive advantage.\n• Performance Indicators: Interregional market share, sales growth rates, sales volume,\nper-liter product prices.\n• Data and Analysis: Using data from Nielsen reports, sales performance and store\navailability rates with market share in each region are examined. The same analyses are\nperformed for the three major competitors and strategic planning is made according to\nthe analysis results.\n• Challenges: In some cases, regional data is missing or reports do not arrive on time,\nmaking the analysis process difficult. Especially in regions far from the center, such as\nEastern Anatolia, some in-store information was entered into the systems late or\nincompletely, making it difficult to make accurate analyses.\n• Benefits: Thanks to this project, regional marketing strategies were developed and it\nwas aimed to implement special campaigns in these regions and areas by identifying\nmissing points. With this project, which is continuously carried out in the long term, it is\naimed to further increase Red Bull's effectiveness and competitive power in the market.\nDue to this project, I understood the importance of data analysis, including competitor\ninformation, in developing new strategies.",

Here, the status of past sales\non a regional basis is also analyzed. In the second stage, the field sales team is asked to make\nestimates for the coming months according to the sales considered in the previous step together\nwith environmental factors. Here, estimates are also asked for the 250, 355 and 473 ml product\nvarieties for the Regular RB product. The reason for this is that the most sold SKU variety, Red\nBull Regular, will be put into campaign applications in the future by cooperating with trade\nmarketing for the products needed in the regions where it is needed. In the third and final step,\nall analyzes are put into dashboards, and it is seen in more detail which customers, regions, and\nof course SKUs the campaigns mentioned in the previous step will be suitable for, and it is\ncommunicated to the department managers, and the relevant campaigns are created with\nconsensus. The aim of this project is to increase profitability by optimizing inventory\nmanagement and logistics planning with accurate forecasting methods.\nStep 1: Analysis of Historical Sales Data for SKU Based Sales Forecast\nThe first phase of this project focuses on analyzing Red Bull’s SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) based\nhistorical sales data in detail. The aim is to prepare the basis for future sales forecasts by\nexamining historical sales data and evaluating the effects of seasonal products such as Summer\nEdition, Winter Edition and environmental factors. This phase provides important information\nabout the performance of products over time by calculating growth rates on a SKU basis.\nThe main goal is to compare performances over time by calculating growth rates for each SKU.\nFor example, RB-001 (Summer Edition) saw a significant increase in sales during the summer\nmonths, while demand dropped significantly during the winter months. In contrast, RB-002\n(Regular Red Bull) showed a stable performance across all four seasons.\nThe table below shows these differences:\nSKU January’24 February’24 March’24 April’24 Growth Rate\nActual Sales Actual Sales Actual Sales Actual Sales (%)\nRB-001 50,000 52,500 55,000 58,000 %16\nRB-002 30,000 31,000 29,500 28,900 -%4\nRB-003 75,000 77,000 80,000 82,500 %10\nTable1: Growth rates table",

In this context, the field sales team is asked to make sales\nforecasts by considering the historical sales data report and environmental factors provided to\nthem.\nIn particular, it is expected that forecasts will increase in the summer months for seasonal\nproducts such as RB-001 (Summer Edition), while the requirements of the period will be taken\ninto account for other SKUs. The table below shows a comparison between the forecasts made\nfor last May and the actual sales:\nSKU Code Forecasted Sales Actual Sales (May) Deviation (%)\n(May)\nRB-001 60,000 58,500 -2.5%\nRB-002 29,000 28,750 -0.9%\nRB-003 85,000 83,000 -2.3%\nTable3: Actual-Prediction Index Table\nIn this example table, the deviations between the big forecast and the actual are largely\nconsistent, but the opposite can often happen. The process of a customer changing their dealer,\nseasonal changes, and even sometimes unpredictable environmental factors can cause the\nforecasts to be wrong. I observed the biggest example of this with the earthquake effect in the\nforecast-actual index for February 2023.\nApart from this, the most demanded SKU, Regular Red Bull, is available in 3 different ml\nquantities. Since the main goal is to maintain and increase sales for each quantity of this SKU,\nthe sales performances of these products were also analyzed. According to the outputs in the\ntable below, the ml varieties that can be applied to the activity were determined as 355 and 473\nml, and then, by drawing the sales of only these two ml products for each customer, it was\ndetermined which customer would be included in the campaign for 355 ml and which customer\nwould be included in the campaign for 473 ml.\nSKU January’24 February’24 March’24 April’24 May’24 June’24 Growth\nKodu Rate\n(%)\nRB- 45,000 47,500 49,000 50,500 52,000 53,500 %18.8\n001\n473ml\nRB- 20,000 21,500 22,000 23,000 24,000 26,000 %30\n001\n250ml\nRB- 10,000 10,500 11,000 11,500 12,000 12,500 %25\n001\n355ml\nTable4: Ml Based Red Bull Regular Analysis Table\nAs a result, this stage is the strategy stage that aims to make more accurate predictions together\nwith historical data and environmental factors.\n14",

I actively used various visual and formula-\nbased features in Excel. I frequently used pivot table and slicer functions; VLOOKUP, SUMIF and\nXLOOKUP formulas. Thanks to this, my Excel skills improved considerably. Sometimes I\ninterpreted the Excel files I created by reflecting them on PowerPoint presentations, which was\na factor that improved my analysis skills. In addition, I gained an idea about how to interpret\ndata in sales strategies, in other words, the basics of sales development processes.\nI saw that engineers working in the sales department generally took an active role in sales\ndevelopment and data analyst sides. I had the opportunity to get to know Industrial Engineers\nworking in these positions in departments such as Traditional Channel Sales and Trade\nMarketing. However, I also observed that the most preferred place by engineers in the company\nis the Supply Chain unit. At this point, all engineers working in the head office work from the\noffice and do not work in the field. While industrial engineers in the sales department aim to\nincrease revenue and sales, those in the logistics and operations department try to make the\nprocess of products reaching the consumer more efficient by controlling areas such as\ntransportation processes and stocks. At this point, I think that this multifaceted job description is\nideal for industrial engineers because in addition to the relationship with data in the sales\ndepartment where I am, there is active communication with field teams in 7 regions and\nenvironmental, social and human relations-oriented analyses are made.\nSince Red Bull is the leader in its category globally with a significant market share, it is very\nimportant to maintain its competitive power and prevent competitors from surpassing or even\napproaching Red Bull sales. For this reason, the company must constantly take appropriate\nsteps, adapt to changes and attract the attention of the consumer with the right marketing\npolicies. At this point, Red Bull is also known for its support for extreme sports and aims to\nappear before consumers in almost every area with the social activities it participates in. In\naddition, attracting consumers' attention in this regard with its care in the field of sustainability\nis critical for the company. I believe that Red Bull will maintain its leading position in the sector\nwith its activity in social areas and creative marketing efforts.",

After giving my internship experience some thought, I've discovered a few crucial\nareas that are crucial for professional practice:\nCommunication: One of the most important competencies I observed during my internship was\ncommunication. Strong and confident communication skills are critical to increased work\nefficiency, especially in a professional environment. Both written and verbal communication are\nvery important, as email is one of the most used tools in corporate communication. Also during\nmy internship, I realized the importance of clear communication with my remote colleagues,\nespecially when coordinating tasks and ensuring harmony with people who are not physically\npresent.\nTime Management: Another basic competency that I noticed is time management. Delays in\ntasks can negatively affect the functioning of a system, especially in a professional environment\nwhere even hourly data is important, such as sales. Effective time management is necessary to\nprioritize tasks correctly and monitor processes efficiently.\nProblem Solving Skills: Problem solving skills are another common competency that employees\nmust have. Especially in times of crisis, it is important to focus on the solution, not the problem,\nby providing stress management. Being able to address problems and develop appropriate\nsolutions regardless of the situation or conditions is critical.\nIn addition to these common competencies, although they will vary depending on the sector,\ndepartment or specific job description, other skills and characteristics that are fundamentally\nbeneficial for individuals are as follows:\n•Ethical Conduct\n•Desire for Knowledge\n•Professional Conduct\n•Leadership Qualities\n•Critical Thinking\n18",

        "content": "DAY 1\nOn the first day of my internship, Ms. Ceylin from the company's Human Resources\ndepartment first gave me an office tour and introduced me to the people in my department\nand the general company operation. The welcome bag in Figure 1 was handled to me. At\nthis point, I received information about the company's history, history, countries it is located\nin globally and its fields of activity. Then, I received an orientation about the departments\nand their working procedures and job descriptions. At the end of the training, a general\ncompany tour was given. Then, I had the opportunity to meet my sales managers and Head\nof Department in my own department. During the rest of the day, I was taught the Excel\nfiles, presentations and data collection systems that I would use during my internship with\njob transfer. In this way, my first day was completed by understanding both the company\noperation and the job description.\nFigure 1: Welcome Bag\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n16.07.2024\n21\n\nDAY 2\nToday, I received an orientation from IT regarding the use of company computers and\ntechnical equipment. In addition to the use of computers and equipment, I also visited the\nmeeting rooms and learned how to use the screens in these rooms and the connection\nprocesses for presentations and online meetings. After this orientation, I continued my\ndepartment orientation that I started on the first day of my internship. Today, unlike the\nprevious day, I also received a job and information transfer about Nielsen report files and\npresentations. Then, I completed the day by attending the product introduction and brand\nvalue presentation for the new interns.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n17.07.2024\nDAY 3\nToday, with the activation of my company email and accounts, I started working on my first\nproject, the budget file. I created a sales report for the first 6 months from the system used\nby the company and created 6-month sales by month with the help of the vlookup formula\nfor 221 customers from the raw data. Then, I divided the invoices by month with the pivot I\ncreated from the 2024 invoice information excel in the archive and determined how much\ninvoice came to each customer by pulling from the central customer codes. In the last stage,\nI multiplied the future invoice budget percentages by the sales amounts to determine the\nprogress payments and then I determined the budgets created by subtracting the invoice\nfrom the progress payments for each customer. At this point, when I needed confirmation\nabout clear information such as future invoice budget percentages or branch numbers, I\ncontacted the field teams from the regions and received verification on behalf of their\ncustomers' information. In this way, I had the opportunity to actively use my communication\nskills and problem-solving abilities.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n18.07.2024\n22\n\nDAY 4\nOn the fourth day of my internship, I continued working on the budget file I worked on\nyesterday. I worked on a dashboard to visualize the data I created yesterday. My goal here\nwas to filter the region, dealers and managers and ensure that the data flowed in visual\ngraphics. I also worked on including the data in the archive into the dashboard so that the\nyears 2022, 2023 and 2024 could be compared visually. I reached a dashboard view as seen\nin Figure 2. The filters I selected with this view allowed me to better understand and\ncomment on regional, customer group breakdown and monthly sales. In this way, I\nunderstood the importance of data visualization and shared my project, which I had been\nworking on for 2 days, with my managers and received their feedback.\nFigure 2: Dashboard\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n19.07.2024\n23\n\nDAY 5\nIn the new week of my internship, I started working on product-based sales as a\ncontinuation of the project I completed last week. At this point, we first determined our\nbest-selling and most popular product types with our manager. Red Bull has a wide range of\nproducts with its regular products, edition varieties and seasonal special products, and we\ndecided which products we should choose when working on sku-based reports. Then, as in\nthe file I created before, I pulled customer-based sales for each customer, but this time I\nadded our product varieties to the columns and made a report of how much each customer\nsold of each type of product. Then, I created a regional summary table and made comments\non which product sold more or less in which region. In addition, we determined the markets\nand product categories with low sales and made inferences about what strategies could be\ndetermined in future campaign periods.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n22.07.2024\nDAY 6\nOn the new day of my internship, I was given the task of creating a forecast file by my\nmanager. I received a file that already collected forecasts for the first 6 months of the year\nat the beginning of the year. Then, I created the realized forecast indexes by adding the\nrealized ones for the first 6 months. The file also contained sales amounts for the 12 months\nof 2023. For this reason, I created a separate index by calculating the YTD sales amounts\nstarting from February for the first 6 months of 2024 and comparing them with the YTDs of\nthe relevant months of 2023. After making all these arrangements, I completed the file by\nopening columns to write the estimates for the remaining months of 2024 and shared the\nfile with all of our Local Key Account Managers and Regional Managers and asked them to\nadd their estimates.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n23.07.2024\n24\n\nDAY 7\nOn the 7th day of my internship, I started analyzing Nielsen reports and putting them into\ngraphs. During this process, I prepared a presentation analyzing factors such as our\ncompany's market share in the sector, our price per liter, and our sales volume. At this point,\nI created graphs comparing the total market share of Red Bull and its competitors in Turkey\nand the market share in the European region of Istanbul, as shown in figure 3. I also created\nsimilar graphs for the regions of our Local Key Account Managers, namely Ankara, Izmir,\nAydin, Manisa, Bursa, and the Anatolian regions of Istanbul. In this way, I had the\nopportunity to comment on the competitors and learn which of our competitors was\nprogressing better in which region and what strategies could be developed accordingly.\nFigure 3: Graphs\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n24.07.2024\n25\n\nDAY 8\nOn the 8th day of my internship, I made a more detailed review and evaluated the brand-\nbased performances and how the products yielded results according to consumer segments.\nFor example, I made inferences about which age group or income level our products were\npopular among consumers and continued the competitor analysis by creating the same\nanalysis for competitors. At this point, since the analyses I made today could also serve\ntrade marketing activities in the future, I contacted this team and shared my analyses with\nthem. At the end of the day, evaluations were made about what actions would be better to\ntake in which region according to the consumer group we had.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n25.07.2024\nDAY 9\nOn the 9th day of my internship, as a result of the meetings we had with my own team and\ntrade marketing teams the other day, I took on a task where I would collect information\nfrom the field about refrigerators and hot-cold display products. I created an excel file and\ncollected the information about the refrigerators that needed to be changed in the stores of\nour Distribution Partner Manager and Local Key Account Managers in the field. I also\ncollected the new refrigerator or display requests and tried to establish a communication\nbridge between the field and the head office with the file I created. In this way, I expanded\nmy professional network by improving my communication processes with DPMs in the\nregions. I also had the opportunity to expand my knowledge of the refrigerated cabinets and\ndisplay areas in stores.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n26.07.2024\n26\n\nDAY 10\nOn the 10th day of my internship, after the task of collecting information from the stores I\nhad done at the end of last week, we visited Sarıyer Market and Anpa Gross Markets located\non the European Side of Istanbul so that I could physically be present in the stores and\nobserve the processes. During these visits, we analyzed the stock status in the store,\nchecked the locations of the cabinets and the placement of the products in the cabinets. At\nthis point, my manager frequently communicated with the merchandise and sales\nrepresentative team working in the field and gave them feedback about the deficiencies and\npositive aspects in the stores. In this way, I understood the importance of communication\nwith the field team in the sales department and how this communication process should be\nmanaged. Then, we took visuals of the stock status and the situation in the stores and\nworked on adding them to the monthly field evaluation presentation.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n29.07.2024\nDAY 11\nFollowing the field visit we made yesterday, today we attended a presentation specially\nprepared for the Merge teams. Since the merge teams of Red Bull and Haribo companies\nwork together, I had the opportunity to attend the sessions of both companies in this\npresentation. I learned about the Perfect Store concept that is aimed to be achieved in\nstores within Red Bull. In this concept, stores are evaluated over 85 points and stores are\nreached to their total points based on many different factors such as the location of the\nproducts, where the cabinets are located in the store, which product types are in the store,\nand special improvement plans and development strategies are applied for stores that\ncannot reach the desired level. In the second half of the day, I attended the product\nintroduction for new members of the team and the presentation of the stores we are in. I\nhad the chance to learn which local chain markets in Istanbul have the highest demand for\nRed Bull products.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n30.07.2024\n27\n\nDAY 12\nToday, I visited one of our supplier dealers in Istanbul to make my last field visit. I had the\nopportunity to observe how stock status is tracked in this dealership, how products are\nshipped, and how product tracking is done in the daily process. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show\nimages from the warehouse and product shipment. Here, I learned the operation of dynamic\nExcel files that contain daily sales targets and progress with hourly revisions according to\ndaily actions, and I observed every stage of the field operation of the sales process that I\nconverted into data at my desk.\nFigure 4 Figure 5\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n31.07.2024\n28",

In this analysis, I assessed the impact on customer loyalty and\nbrand awareness in addition to sales success. This meant I had to use my analysis\nskills from a broader perspective.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\nBilge Özsoy\n06.08.2024\n30",
