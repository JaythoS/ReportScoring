This\nintegrated approach not only enhances operational efficiency but also positions EGON as a\ncompetitive player in its industry.\nFigure 2: Company Organization Chart\n6\n\nc. Production/Service System\nEGON operates a highly structured production and service system that ensures the delivery\nof renewable energy solutions. This system involves multiple major components, including\nmarketing, manufacturing, finance, purchasing, and sales, which are all interconnected to\nachieve the company's sustainability goals. Figure 3 shows the flow chart in the\nproduction/service system of the company.\nFigure 3: Flow chart\nThe flowchart outlines the process for requesting renewable energy installations and how\nthe system manages energy production and distribution within the Renewable Energy\nCommunity (REC). The process begins when a customer requests the installation of\nrenewable energy systems, such as solar panels or wind turbines. The marketing and sales\nteams are involved in promoting this service and engaging customers. Once the installation\nis completed, the customer begins producing energy through the installed renewable\nsystems. Manufacturing teams handle the installation, while purchasing ensures materials\nare procured for each project.\nAfter production begins, the system checks whether the energy produced exceeds the\ncustomer’s consumption. If production exceeds consumption, the process continues to\nexplore ways to send excess energy to the community or the grid. If not, the energy is used\nsolely by the customer, with no excess capacity. When there is excess production, customers\nmay request to join the REC. Once part of the REC, customers can feed excess energy into\nthe community grid. The final step in the process assesses whether the produced energy can\nfeed the community. If so, energy is sent to the REC; otherwise, it is sent back to the\nnational grid.\nIn this process, productive elements include the installation of renewable energy systems,\nenergy production, and the integration of energy into the REC or grid. These elements\ngenerate direct value for both customers and the community. Conversely, non-productive\n7\n\nelements consist of request handling and the administrative aspects of sending excess\nenergy to the grid, which do not directly yield revenue.\nPerformance is measured through various metrics, including installation time, energy\nproduction, contributions to the REC, and overall customer satisfaction. EGON uses\nforecasting tools based on market demand and energy trends to estimate customer needs\nand installation capacity, ensuring resource availability and service delivery within expected\ntimelines. For inventory management, EGON employs Just-in-Time (JIT) practices to ensure\nthat materials, such as solar panels and wind turbines, are available as needed, thus\nminimizing holding costs. So, this system with REC helps people with their energy bills and\nreduce them.\n8\n\nd.

Summer Practice Description\nDuring my summer internship at Energiegemeinschaften Niederösterreich, I engaged in a range\nof engineering activities centered on optimizing renewable energy production and consumption\nin the Heiligenkreuz community. This experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge\nfrom my studies to real-world situations while gaining valuable insights into the renewable\nenergy sector. Below are the main activities I performed during my internship:\n• Data Collection and Analysis\n• Cost Analysis Study\n• Observation of the Production\n• Prediction of Energy Based on the Data\n• Activity Analysis\nData Collection and Analysis: For a certain part of my internship, I examined the energy\nproduction and consumption of a renewable energy community in Heiligenkreuz. During this\nobservation, I learned what certain energy codes mean. These were 1.8.0, 1.9.0, 2.8.0, 2.9.0\nand 2.9.1 (OneMeter, 2024). Total consumption, import-export from the grid, total\nproduction, production to grid, energy provided to energy community, respectively.\nIt can also represent Total consumption, import-export from the grid, consumption from the\ngrid and energy consumed from the grid. Thanks to these codes and the energy production-\nconsumption data from smart meters, I had the chance to create a table and analyze it. In\nTable 1.1: Metering Point Productions I added that data. In those tables codes represent the\nproduction of the panels. Using that data I made some analysis.\nTable 1.1: Metering Point Productions\nAs I observed from these meters, the renewable energy producer with the meter number\nAT001000000000000001000015197451 on the right produces more energy, 255.14 kW, and\nthe other meter with the meter number AT00100000000000001000014253155 produces\nmore energy than 86.090 kW. I observed. There may be many reasons for this, some of\nwhich are panel efficiency, tilt and orientation, cleanliness and maintenance, microclimate\ndifferences, hardware variations, and shading or physical obstructions can cause production\ndifferences between two solar energy systems in the same region.\n11\n\nHowever, when we look at it in comparison, we see that both provide most of the energy\nthey produce to the energy community and the remaining part to the grid. For instance,\nwhen we look at the 15-day production table, the panel with high production provides\n98.83% of the energy it produces for the community. The other panel provides 97.36% of its\nproduction to the community. This shows that the company really fulfills its promises on a\nlarge scale.\nCost Analysis Study: In this analysis, I examine the billing data related to energy production\nand consumption within our community for the date of 18th July 2024. The data includes 25\nunique bills, reflecting either the net gain or loss in euros due to energy produced (as\npositive values) or consumed (as negative values). Understanding this balance is essential for\nevaluating our overall energy efficiency and sustainability. In the Table 1.2 Cost Analysis I\nwrote the data for 25 clients for the july.\nTable 1.2: Cost Analysis\nThe total number of bills recorded is 25. The gross amounts indicate various figures of\nenergy produced or consumed, with some values indicating a negative balance, suggesting\n12\n\nthat energy consumption exceeded production. The positive values indicate net energy\nproduction or credits that contribute positively to our energy balance.\nHere’s a summary of the calculations:\n1. Total Energy Produced (in euros):\n- Sum of all positive values:\n0.42 + 24.08 + 41.28 + 1.5 + 6.82 + 11.74 + 4.43 + 4.26 + 0.83 + 52.07 + 26.23 + 16.68 + 5.99 +\n32.24 + 23.83 + 0.62 = 239.48€\n2. Total Energy Consumed (in euros):\n- Sum of all negative values:\n-4.55 - 36.39 - 30.49 - 104.68 - 8.64 - 7.73 - 17.24 = -309.00€\n3. Net Balance:\n-Total Energy Produced + Total Energy Consumed = Net Balance\n239.48 - 309.00 = -69.52€\nThe overall net balance for our community on this date was negative, highlighting that\nenergy consumption exceeded production by 69.52€. This indicates that, while some\naccounts produced a significant amount of energy, others consumed more than they\nproduced, resulting in an overall deficit.\nThe highest positive value recorded is 52.07€ (ID 14), representing a significant contribution.\nConversely, the negative values indicate net energy consumption or debit, with the largest\nnegative value being -104.68€ (ID 13), which signifies a high consumption level or loss in that\naccount.\nTo optimize our community’s energy efficiency, we should focusing on addressing accounts\nwith significant negative balances to enhance sa",

Implementing energy efficiency\nmeasures could help reduce high consumption rates, particularly in accounts like ID 13.\nEncouraging more solar energy usage could increase our total production credits, especially\nduring peak sunlight hours.\nObservation of the Production: During my internship, I had the opportunity to observe the\nproduction processes involved in manufacturing solar panels and smart meters. Although it\nis not a large company, it serves a niche market primarily consisting of clients who already\nhave solar panels or wind turbines installed in their homes or small businesses.\nThe production line was organized into distinct stages, including raw material preparation,\nassembly, quality inspection, and packaging. Each stage was streamlined to ensure\nefficiency, with strict inventory management practices in place. I noted the integration of\nphotovoltaic cells, framing, and glass lamination during the assembly of solar panels. Quality\ncontrol measures were consistently applied, with regular inspections to maintain product\nintegrity.\n13\n\nEGON has also developed smart meters that can calculate energy production every three\nseconds, automatically uploading this data for real-time monitoring. This technology\nenhances energy management for clients, providing accurate insights into their production\nand consumption.\nEfficiency metrics and key performance indicators were tracked to optimize output levels,\nand a strong culture of collaboration among team members fostered a positive work\nenvironment. Safety was prioritized, with regular training and adherence to protocols to\nminimize risks.\nSustainability practices were also a focus, with waste reduction initiatives and energy-\nefficient measures implemented throughout the facility. Overall, my observations at EGON\noffered valuable insights into the complexities of solar panel and meter manufacturing,\nenhancing my understanding of production management within the renewable energy\nsector.\nPrediction of Energy Based on the Data: In my analysis, I conducted a prediction for the\nsolar energy production on Day 16 based on the data provided from the previous 15 days. I\nrecognized that this prediction is essential for understanding future energy production\ntrends and making informed decisions. I used AT0010000000000000001000014253155\npanel’s production in table 1.1 for prediction. Also I added my calculations based on simple\nlinear reggression on Table 1.3. I made these calculations by using excel.\nCalculate Averages:\nTable 1.3\nFirst, in the (X - X') column, I calculated the difference between each X value (days) and the\nmean of the X values (the average day). Similarly, in the (Y - Y') column, I found the\ndifference between each Y value (energy production) and the mean of the Y values (the\naverage energy production). These differences help understand the distribution and\nrelationship between the variables.\n14\n\nNext, in the (X - X')*(Y - Y') column, the product of the differences for X and Y, I calculated for\neach day. These values represent the covariance between X and Y, which is essential to find\nthe slope m. In the (X - X')^2 column, the squared differences for X were computed, which\nare used to calculate the variance of X.\nAt the bottom of the table, the sums of each column are provided. In the table, the sum of\n(X - X')*(Y - Y') is 1.831, and the sum of (X - X')^2 is 280. Using these values, the slope is m=\n280/1831 = 0.006539. This slope indicates the rate of change in energy production as the\ndays progress.\nThen,I calculated the intercept. Here, Y' is the mean of the Y values (5.7393333) and X' is the\nmean of the X values (8). Using these values, I found the intercept b = 5.687019.\nFinally, using the slope and intercept, the linear equation is formed: Y = mX + b\nUsing this equation, I predict the energy production for the 16th day (X = 16):\nY16 = 0.006539*16 + 5.687019 = 5.791648\nAs a result, the predicted energy production for July 16, 2024, is approximately 5.791648kW.\nIn my analysis, I conducted a prediction for the solar energy production on Day 16 based on\nthe data provided from the previous 15 days. I recognized that this prediction is essential for\nunderstanding future energy production trends and making informed decisions. I used the\nproduction data from the AT0010000000000000001000014253155 panel in the dataset.\nTo cal",

After\nanalyzing the historical data, I found that the predicted energy production for Day 16 is\napproximately 5.79 kW. This prediction will help in planning and optimizing energy usage.\nWhen I compared the energy production I calculated on the 16th day with the real data, I\nsaw that the real data was 2,054kW. Since all of this data is created by state-of-the-art smart\nmeters, the margin of error is quite low. What I predicted was 5.791648kW. When we look\nat it, there is actually a very small difference between the two, but proportionally the\nprediction seems to be quite unsuccessful. Error rate is 35.46%. Although it does not seem\nlike a very accurate prediction mathematically, this data may actually differ due to external\nfactors. It seems likely that the low sunshine rate of that day could cause this kW to increase\nby half.\n15\n\n3. Conclusions\nI engaged in various engineering activities aimed at optimizing renewable energy production\nand consumption. I performed a range of activities, including data collection and analysis,\ncost analysis study, observation of production processes, and prediction of energy\nproduction. In data collection and analysis, I examined energy production and consumption\nwithin the renewable energy community, focusing on specific energy codes that relate to\ntotal consumption, grid import/export, and energy provided to the community. The cost\nanalysis study involved analyzing billing data for energy production and consumption. I\nassessed the net gains or losses among community members.\nDuring my observation of production, I noted the manufacturing processes of solar panels\nand smart meters, identifying the various stages involved, quality control measures, and\nsustainability practices in place. Additionally, I utilized historical data to predict solar energy\nproduction. From these activities, I gained a deeper understanding of how energy codes\naffect production and consumption analysis and the importance of accurate data collection\nfor optimizing energy efficiency.\nThe sector faces significant challenges. One of the major challenges is it faces in the Austrian\nmarket is the high level of competition, with many players offering similar services.
