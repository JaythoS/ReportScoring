So, I had the opportunity to gain a lot of experience such as better understanding of\nhuman relations, observing the projects of engineers, participating in company projects and\nrelations, learning about investigations applied to company employees that served. I mostly\nworked with Mr. Erdem, who is the manager newly participated to team from KPMG, and\nMiss. Priyeva, who is the Senior Associate.\nSince the first day of the internship, I attended the Market Research for the very known\nbevarege company in Türkiye. The purpose of the research is to confirm that company had\npaid exorbitant prices to products they supplied from a supplier. My superiors were very\nsatisfied with the job I have done because they were not able to find every purchase order\ngiven from the client, but I have shown success with %51 accurate pricing and %35 semi\npricing. Every day at the end of the day, I prepared a progress report with the data that Miss.\nPriyeva gave. In the report, it is written that the names of the purchase orders, the total\namount of order, the details about orders, the price taken by the client and the price I found\nfrom different suppliers across Türkiye. With these data, I prepared an excel that includes\neverything and will help the client to compare prices.\nThe responsible/managers and the partner of Forensic, examined the sheet I have made at\nthe end of the project and stated the importance of duty I have done to closing the project.\nMr. Erdem mostly gave me duties with business development of forensic technologies which\nis supplying to clients and evaluated me the systems we are developing.

I cannot provide company names due to confidentiality. This report aims to\ndetail my activities, learning experiences, and contributions during my time at PwC, as well\n11\n\nas my superiors' evaluations of my performance. PwC conducts multiple projects and serving\nmultiple clients at the same time using its workforce by dividing team in sub-teams with\ntheir professionalism.\nHere I learned that the importance of working clear and tidy. Because the job that\nmay you started can be continued by someone else from your team and it may also be\nreverse. And the importance of confidentiality has helped me to understand by my\nsupevisors.\nThroughout my internship, I actively participated in various projects that allowed me\nto apply theoretical knowledge in practical settings. The three key projects I participated in\nwere:\nPEP: The PEP project focused on identifying and analyzing the company spendings due to\nsuspicions of company executives. My primary responsibility was conducting market\nresearch to provide accurate and timely information about these individuals. I utilized\nvarious tools, including PwC's proprietary databases and publicly available information, to\ngather relevant data. This involved analyzing information for accuracy and relevance, which\ncontributed to the project’s success.\nData Collection: I gathered data on 120 Purchase orders, ensuring that 95% of the\ninformation sourced was from authenticated databases.\nAccuracy Metrics: I achieved a pricing accuracy of 51% and a semi-priced accuracy of 35%,\nsignificantly contributing to the overall effectiveness of the PEP project.\nCCN: In this project, I assisted in analyzing the data and creating excel sheets to make Mr.\nErdems duty easier I made some data clearazation and sorting to find expected suspicious\ndatas. I learnt financial codes 1,2,3,4,5,6 while doing the duty and I showed RStudio\nprogramme to my supervisor and tought him to use it which he excited and helped us to\nfinish job easier. My tasks included sorting the present data on existing compliance\npractices, identifying gaps, and suggesting improvements. This required me to engage in\nextensive data analyzing to benchmark client practices against industry standards, which\nallowed me to understand the broader fraud landscape.\nBenchmarking Data: I analyzed 150 suppliers’ including the sub companies of the client fraud\npractices, identifying that 45% had gaps in their reporting mechanisms, which informed our\nrecommendations.\nMAIS: My role in the MAIS project involved consulting on crisis management within\norganizations. I investigated employee financial behaviors by analyzing bank account details\n(IBANs) and transaction patterns. This aspect of the project required a keen eye for detail\nand strong analytical skills to identify any anomalies that could indicate unethical practices.\nFraud Risk Assessment: One of my primary responsibilities was to assist in conducting fraud\nrisk assessments for our clients. This involved reviewing existing policies and procedures to\nidentify vulnerabilities that could expose the organization to fraud. I collaborated with my\nteam to analyze the internal controls in place and assess their effectiveness in mitigating\nfraud risks.\nControl Evaluation: I helped evaluate twenty different internal controls, identifying 15 areas\nfor potential improvement. This process enhanced my understanding of the importance of\nrobust control mechanisms in preventing fraudulent activities.\n12\n\nEmployee Analysis: I reviewed fourteen employee IBANs and transaction histories,\nsuccessfully identifying 2 potential cases that warranted further investigation.\nAs part of my involvement in the PEP project, I performed extensive market research,\nachieving a 51% accuracy in pricing and 35% in semi-priced outcomes. This involved:\nField Visits: I conducted field visits to the Karaköy and Ikitelli industrial areas, gathering\npricing samples from ten different suppliers. These firsthand approaches allowed me to gain\npractical insights into the pricing dynamics and market conditions relevant to the PEP\nproject.\nReporting: I contributed to the reporting segment of the general report for the client by\nsynthesizing the findings from my market research. This involved presenting the data in a\nclear and concise manner, which was critical for facilitating decision-making by our clients.\nDuring my internship, I also learned about three key services offered by the PwC Forensic\nServices department:\nCorporate Intelligence Service: This service provides clients with detailed insights about\ncompanies using automated tools that aggregate information from verified sources and\nPwC’s extensive database. The ability to provide comprehensive reports on companies and\nsuppliers helps clients make informed decisions regarding potential partnerships or\ninvestments. The accuracy of these reports was consistently above 90%, ensuring reliable\ninformation for clients.\nEthics Center: The Ethics Center assists organizations in managing ethical violations by\noffering a platform for human resources to report complaints. Understanding the\nfunctionality and importance of this service highlighted how PwC supports clients in\nmaintaining ethical standards within their organizations. During my internship, I observed\nthat 25% of reported complaints led to actionable insights for our clients.\nCompliance Search Engine: This tool enables clients to conduct thorough compliance checks\nand due diligence on various entities. My participation in testing this tool and assisting in the\ndesign of its webpage allowed me to see the intersection of technology and forensic services\nin enhancing compliance practices.\n13\n\nTable 4: Ethics&Compliance Management services of PwC Forensic Services\nBusiness Development Contributions\nAs part of my responsibilities, I also focused on business development initiatives related to\nthe three services:\nEvaluating the Robot: I played a role in evaluating the automated tools used in the\nCorporate Intelligence Service. My findings and feedback helped the team refine the\nfunctionality of these tools, ensuring they met client needs effectively, contributing to a\nincrease in operational efficiency.\nWebpage Design: I assisted in designing a user-friendly webpage for the services offered by\nthe department. The newly designed webpage increased user engagement.\nData Analysis and RStudio\nIn my role, I contributed to data analysis efforts by creating Excel sheets that streamlined\nprocesses for my supervisor, Mr. Erdem. I performed data clarification and sorting to\nidentify potentially suspicious patterns. This not only improved the efficiency of our\ninvestigations but also enhanced my analytical skills.\nExcel Tools: I developed 5 key Excel tools that automated the data sorting process, reducing\nthe time required for analysis by approximately 30%.\nI also introduced my supervisor to RStudio, a programming environment for statistical\ncomputing and graphics. After demonstrating its capabilities, I assisted him in utilizing\nRStudio for data analysis, which significantly simplified our workflow and enabled us to\nanalyze larger datasets more effectively.\nRStudio Implementation: We used RStudio to analyze a dataset of 3000+ entries, resulting in\nclearer insights into potential fraud patterns.\nThe experiences I gained during my internship at PwC which is one of the biggest consulting\nfirms in the world were invaluable. Some of the key lessons learned include:\n14\n\nImportance of Clarity and Tidiness: I recognized the need for clear and organized\ndocumentation. Projects can be handed over to different team members, making it essential\nto maintain a tidy workflow to ensure continuity and efficiency.\nUnderstanding Fraud Risks: I gained a deeper understanding of the several types of fraud\nand the importance of initiative-taking risk management strategies. Learning how to identify\nred flags and vulnerabilities in business operations was particularly enlightening.\nData Analysis Skills: My involvement in data analytics strengthened my analytical skills and\nprovided me with practical experience in preparing and visualizing data for fraud detection.\nConfidentiality: My superiors emphasized the significance of confidentiality in forensic\nservices. Understanding how to manage sensitive information responsibly has prepared me\nfor future roles in the field.\nCollaborative Teamwork: Collaborating with various sub-teams taught me the value of\ncollaboration and leveraging diverse expertise to achieve project goals.\nApplication of Ethical Principles: I learned the ethical standards that govern the forensic\nconsulting industry.
