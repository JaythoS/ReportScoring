We worked on the\nCorporate Intelligence service, where her expertise in regulatory frameworks and\ncompliance issues was instrumental. Together, we conducted extensive research to gather\nrelevant information for our clients, ensuring that our recommendations were both\nactionable and aligned with legal standards.

The\nlessons learned from collaborating with my colleagues will undoubtedly serve as a\nfoundation for my professional growth moving forward.\nc. Self-directed Learning\nThroughout my internship at PwC, I embraced self-directed learning as a key component\nof my professional development. Recognizing the importance of continuous improvement in\na challenging environment, I sought opportunities to enhance my skills and knowledge\nindependently. One of the most significant areas I focused on was Excel proficiency. With\nthe guidance of Mr. Kayar, I was able to delve deeper into advanced Excel functionalities,\nlearning essential techniques such as pivot tables, advanced formulas, and data visualization\nmethods. And learned excel web format which has different futures but also helps to use\nsharing excel sheet. This not only improved my efficiency in handling data but also equipped\nme with the necessary tools to contribute effectively to various projects. I also had to chance\nto experience the theoretical RStudio that I learnt to practical. And with the most exciting\nthing I had to chance to experience the “ChatPwC” which is a product of OpenAI like\nChatGPT, but it is all designed for PwC with a collaboration it offers more confidentiality,\nmore authentic information powered by PwC database. Additionally, PwC provided a range\nof specialized training sessions aimed at fostering professional growth. These trainings\ncovered critical aspects of forensic services, including ethical standards, compliance\nprotocols, and advanced analytical methods. Participating in these sessions allowed me to\ndeepen my understanding of the industry and stay updated with the latest practices. The\ncombination of formal training and self-directed study significantly enriched my internship\nexperience, empowering me to take on new challenges with confidence and competence.\nThrough this initiative-taking approach to learning, I developed a more comprehensive skill\nset that not only benefited my contributions during the internship but also laid a solid\nfoundation for my future career in forensic services.",
