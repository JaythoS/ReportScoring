My\nobservations of the effectiveness of quality assurance processes aligned with what I learned about\nquality management systems. In order to increase the efficiency of the production process, I\nobserved quality control processes and better understood the role of these processes in industrial\nengineering. My experiences in team communication and project management skills were\n\nsignificantly enhanced during the internship. These activities strengthened the connections\nbetween my major studies in industrial engineering and provided me with deeper theoretical\nknowledge alongside practical skills development.\nIn the initial stage of the activity, after receiving the work order, design engineers drew a\ngenerator model. This model is below:\nThen, the dimensions of the generator were determined as follows: length 2900 mm, width\n1100 mm, and height 1800 mm. The aim of determining the dimensions is if any part of the\ngenerator needs to be replaced, these drawings are used to provide the correct size part. In addition,\nthe dimensions in the drawing can be checked to see if the generator is suitable for the dimensions\nof the area where it will be placed.\nAfter that, we collaborated with the production planning manager and process engineers to\ncreate monthly and weekly plans. We conducted a thorough analysis to determine the required\nworkforce and material needs. While setting our production targets, we considered historical\nproduction data and market demands. At this stage, I recorded the data in Excel and assisted the\nrelevant units while creating the supply lists. For example, below is the bearing supply list I\ncreated:\n\nThis bearing procurement list has been created for the purpose of ordering various materials\nand equipment to be used in the generator production process. The list covers a wide range of\nproducts, from gloves and pipe wrenches to tapes and hoses. A total of 16 different products are\nincluded, and quantities have been specified for each item. Bearings play a critical role in the\ngenerator production process by ensuring that moving parts operate smoothly and efficiently. For\nexample, during the rotational movement of the generator's rotor, bearings minimize friction,\nenhance energy efficiency, and prevent wear. Therefore, selecting the correct type and quality of\nbearings is crucial for the generator's longevity and trouble-free operation. With this procurement\nlist, we aim to ensure the complete acquisition of the necessary bearings and other related\ncomponents required for the generator production process.\n\nThis is the electrical material list I prepared:\nThis Excel sheet has been prepared for the procurement of electrical and mechanical\nconnection materials to be used in the generator production process. The materials listed have been\nidentified to ensure the correct and safe assembly of various components of the generator.\nElectrical materials play a critical role in both the creation of the generator's electrical circuits and\nthe assembly of its mechanical parts.\nWe allocated a total of 1200 hours of labor to produce four generators, averaging 300 hours\nof labor per generator. The hours per generator were 287.5, a deviation of -12.5 hours. This\nreduction in time demonstrates improvements in workflow and the potential for scaling production\nin future projects. Our material list included the engine, chassis, electrical components, and other\nnecessary parts, totaling approximately 4000 kg of materials. There was a waste of 200 kg of\nmaterials and the targeted 100% material efficiency was not as expected.\nAfter that, we identified material shortages and communicated with suppliers. The\nidentified missing materials were:\n● Engine Coolant - 20 liters\n● Oil - 30 liters\n● Battery - 4 units\n● Control Board - 4 units\n● Cables and Connectors - 100 meters\n● Fuses - 20 units\n\nThe procurement time for these materials varied based on their type. For instance, the\nprocurement time for engine coolant and oil was estimated at 1-3 days, while batteries and control\nboards required 3-5 days. Effectively managing procurement timelines was crucial for ensuring\nour production schedule progressed without interruptions. Timely identification of material\nshortages and prompt ordering enhanced the efficiency of our production process. Once we\ncompleted the material needs and labor planning, we integrated this data into the production plan.\nThe production plan included the production schedule for the generators, the necessary workforce\ndistribution, and material flow. At this stage, we precisely determined when and in what quantities\nmaterials would be required.\nAfter finalizing the production plan, we distributed it to the relevant units involved in the\nproduction process:\n● Electrical Unit: Planning the assembly and testing processes of electrical components. I\ncontributed to the preparation of the electrical connection diagram and checked the\nrequired parts during assembly.\n● Mechanical Unit: Assembly of the chassis and engine and checking mechanical\ncomponents. I assisted in the assembly of mechanical parts and supported quality control\nprocesses.\n● Cutting Unit: Cutting processes for metals and other materials. I helped plan cutting\nprocesses and prepared checklists to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of material cutting.\n● Bending Unit: Planning the bending operations of metal parts. I monitored the regular\nmaintenance of the machines used in this process.\n● Welding Unit: Performing welding operations during assembly. I provided safety\ninformation regarding welding equipment to fellow interns and assisted in quality control\nchecks.\n● Cabin Unit: Production and assembly of the generator cabin. I contributed to the cabin\ndesign and assembly.\n● Testing Unit: Conducting performance tests on the produced generators. I observed the\ntesting processes and monitored the performance of the generators.\nEach unit followed the production plan distributed to them, determining when and how to\nuse the materials throughout the process. This communication and coordination facilitated a\n\nsmooth progression of the production process. I was involved in the production process as an\nindustrial engineering intern, and I also helped the technicians and examined every stage of the\nprocess.\nBelow is the image of the electrical panel where the components that control the operation\nof the generators are assembled:\nI learned that the electrical panel in this image plays a critical role in generators and is\ntypically used for control, monitoring, and safety purposes. The control system in this panel is used\nto start or stop the generator in case of an emergency and to monitor various parameters. Various\nrelays and fuses are included in this panel to protect the generator against overload, low voltage,\nexcessive temperature, or other fault conditions. These protective components ensure the safe\noperation of the generator. The terminal blocks and power supply units in the panel are used to\nsafely distribute the electricity generated by the generator to various locations. Electrical panels\nensure that this electricity is transmitted at the correct voltage and amperage levels.\n\nI had the opportunity to observe the production of the engine block, which is considered\nthe heart of a generator. This process includes various steps such as casting, machining, quality\ncontrol, and assembly. In the photo below, the engine is displayed:\nFirst, all the technical details of the engine block were determined. Then, molds were\nprepared using durable and high-temperature resistant materials and molten metal was poured into\nthese molds. The cooled engine block was brought to the desired shape during the processing phase\nand its surfaces were smoothed. Finally, other parts were assembled into the engine block and\ncompleted. During the internship, I took part in every stage of engine block production and\nobserved how delicate and careful this process is. I also learned the general features of the engine\nand the effects of these features. An Excel sheet containing the general features of the engine is\nbelow:\n\nWhile preparing this sheet, I also learned how features affect the engine. For example, I\nlearned that the total volume of the cylinders is directly related to the engine's power, that a high\ncompression ratio means higher efficiency, that standby power is the reserve power used for\nemergency situations, and that prime power is the power used for continuously operating\napplications. At 100% load, the generator consumes 21.25 liters of fuel per hour, which is the\nmaximum fuel consumption. When the load drops to 75%, the fuel consumption decreases to 16.01\nliters/hour, which represents a reduction of approximately 24.65%. When the load drops to 50%,\nthe fuel consumption decreases further to 10.58 liters/hour, which is a reduction of 33.94%. In\ndoing this analysis, we have made the following criticism: As the load decreases, the amount of\nfuel used to produce a unit of power decreases. This means that the engine operates more\nefficiently at low loads. However, at very low loads, the engine's efficiency may decrease again.\nThe production of the alternator, which converts mechanical energy into electrical energy,\nbegan. I closely observed the process and assisted the technicians. After manufacturing some parts\nof the stator and rotor, they were machined to the required dimensions and their surfaces were\nfinished. The stator laminations were cut using laser or plasma cutting units. An insulation process\nwas applied to prevent the windings from short-circuiting. Once all the parts were assembled, the\n\nelectrical unit made the connections and installed auxiliary electrical equipment like the voltage\nregulator. After undergoing necessary electrical and mechanical tests, the alternator was sent for\npainting.\n\nThe visual of the laser cutting machine used at this stage is below.\n\nI then created an Excel file containing the specifications of the manufactured alternator:\nMy involvement in the production of key components, such as the engine block and\nalternator, allowed me to appreciate the intricate details that contribute to a generator's\nperformance. I learned how engineering specifications directly influence fuel efficiency and\noperational reliability. The collaborative efforts among different units emphasized the necessity of\nclear communication and coordination in achieving a successful production outcome. Overall, this\nexperience not only reinforced my theoretical knowledge in industrial engineering but also\nenhanced my practical skills in problem-solving and teamwork.\nAs the production process progressed, we successfully completed the production of semi-\nfinished products, a critical phase in the overall project. When we faced an unexpected delay from\nour supplier for a specific type of connector used in the production of electrical panels, we\nreviewed our production plan and developed an alternative solution. In this process, we conducted\na critical path analysis with our electrical unit and reorganized the production sequence. By\npostponing the final stage where the connectors were used, we continued the assembly of other\ncomponents on the production line. In this way, we managed to complete different components\nwithout completely stopping production. Once the connector supply was completed, we returned\n\nthe production line to its previous state as soon as possible and completed the delivery to the\ncustomer on the promised date without any delay. This experience once again demonstrated the\nimportance of flexibility in production planning and allowed us to develop different scenarios for\npotential risks.\nI also actively participated in producing essential components, including the cabin, chassis,\npanel, and various mechanical parts. By meticulously checking the suitability of the materials used,\nI coordinated closely with my teammates to ensure that each component met our strict quality\nstandards and was produced on schedule. Once the semi-finished products were completed, we\nseamlessly transitioned to the assembly of the generators. During this phase, I took the opportunity\nto observe the testing processes, closely monitoring the calibration of the testing equipment to\nensure accuracy. I assisted in conducting a range of tests, including load tests, voltage assessments,\nand current measurements; I recorded each result with precision and contributed to their thorough\nanalysis. After the testing was finalized, I ensured that all relevant information for each generator\nwas accurately entered into the system. My attention to detail extended to the invoicing process,\nwhere I helped guarantee the correct preparation of invoices, ensuring all necessary information\nwas complete and accurate. These documents played a crucial role in the documentation of the\nshipping process, which is vital for maintaining efficient operations. Furthermore, we established\nthe shipment dates for the generators and developed a comprehensive loading plan. Collaborating\nwith logistics teams, I contributed to arranging the necessary logistics for the shipment, which\nhighlighted the importance of effective communication across departments.",
