Surrounding the building are\noutdoor equipment and vehicle parking lots that support the technical infrastructure. There\nare four switchboards connected to the Gayrettepe Telekom Directorate: one in Gayrettepe,\none in Beşiktaş and two in Levent. The switchboards in Levent are divided into Levent 1 and\nLevent 2. In the indoor exchange, the system is fed by copper cable. In the outdoor power\nplant, the system is distributed with fiber and then copper until the location to be served. In\norder not to increase the losses in the copper cable too much, it should not exceed 100-150\nmeters, but the lines fed from the indoor power plant are sold to customers who do not\nrequire high speed such as atm.\nWhen looking at the number of employees, Gayrettepe Türk Telekom's group consists of\nskilled workers, managers, support workers, experts, and specialists. Blue-collar workers,\nknown as professionals, are a group of 50 people who manage the company's operations.\nWhite-collar workers are a group of about 20 professionals working in management, customer\nservice, office, and support areas. In addition, there are approximately 10 engineers working\non telecommunications, network infrastructure, software development and customer\nsolutions. These engineers play an important role in the development of Türk Telekom's\ntechnological infrastructure and the improvement of customer solutions.\nThe total number of staff working at the Gayrettepe Türk Telekom Directorate is\napproximately 100 people. However, there are also Türk Telekom Regional and General\nDirectorates in Gayrettepe. The number of employees working there is even higher.\nTürk Telekom cooperates with many companies, both competitors and customers and\nbusiness partners. Its competitors include companies with ICTA licenses such as Türknet,\nTürksat, Super Online, Turkcell, Vodafone and D-Smart. These companies compete in the\nmarket by offering various telecommunications services. At the same time, in some cases they\ncooperate to offer more comprehensive solutions to customers.\nTürk Telekom's customer base is quite diverse. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs),\nindividual users, small office home office (SOHO) users, small and medium-sized enterprises\n(SMEs), large-scale enterprises and public institutions constitute the strategic customer\nsegments. This wide range of customers reflects the diversity and scope of Türk Telekom's\nservices.\nIn terms of suppliers, Türk Telekom cooperates with telecommunications equipment and\ntechnological infrastructure providers, software companies and infrastructure service\nproviders. These suppliers provide the hardware and software services necessary for Türk\nTelekom to provide the best service to its customers. The necessity to procure a portion of\nthe capital expenditures from foreign companies and the need to finance the capital\nexpenditures with long-term and diversified funding sources cause Türk Telekom to carry\nliabilities denominated in foreign currencies. In this respect, Türk Telekom has net liabilities\ndenominated in foreign currencies when hedging transactions are not taken into account and\nmay be exposed to foreign exchange rate risks due to fluctuating exchange rates, which may\nhave an impact on the financial statements.\nTürk Telekom is one of the largest telecommunications companies in Turkey in terms of sales,\nwith an annual turnover of billions of Turkish liras. Gayrettepe Telekom Board of Directors\nestimates annual sales to be in the hundreds of millions of TL.\nSUMMARY FINANCIAL RESULTS\n6\n\nFigure 3. Consolidated condensed statement of profit/loss\nFigure 4. Summary Consolidated Balance Sheet\nFigure 5. Subscriber Performance\n7\n\nFigure 6. ARPU (Average Revenue Per User) Performance\nTürk Telekom is the leader in terms of market share in secure broadband and mobile services.\nIn the telecommunications market, it competes with Turkcell and Vodafone with a market share\nof 30-35 percent. This document shows that Gayrettepe Türk Telekom Board of Directors is in\nan important position in terms of both service and cooperation.\nb.

Summer Practice Description\nI present below the main list and descriptions of the activities I carried out at Türk Telekom\nduring my summer internship. I have also tried to include relevant technical information and\nreferences about the equipment, tools, processes I observed or used.\nCommercial Operations and Customer Service\nI participated in individual and corporate customer service processes in Commercial Activities.\nIndividual customer service was also divided into two. One was responsible for sales and the\nother for after-sales processes. I experienced both. I conducted after-sales customer\nsatisfaction surveys and analyzes. At the same time, together with the employees, we\nevaluated customer complaints and offered solutions.\nThe relevance of this department to my main work is that improving customer satisfaction\nand service quality directly contributes to the service improvement and process optimization\nareas of industrial engineering.\nCustomer service professionals are very interested in seeing how customer relations are\nhandled in the real world. It has especially improved my ability to deal with difficult customers\nand find solutions quickly.\nI have gained experience in customer satisfaction and complaint handling.\nI gained knowledge on improving service processes and increasing efficiency. Most\nimportantly, it helped me understand the importance of customer relations and how to\nestablish a one-to-one relationship with customers during work.\nField Operations and Access\nThere were parts of this unit where I helped more. I had the chance to monitor the daily\noperations of field teams and provide support. I participated in the processes of laying fiber\noptic and copper cables, solving field cabinet failures. I also observed fault detection and\nrepair processes.\nField operations directly contribute to the process management and operational efficiency of\nindustrial engineering.\nFor me, it was a very interesting and instructive experience to work with the technical teams\nin this unit and observe the field operations on site. It was also quite physically challenging.\nI gained technical knowledge about fiber optic, internet connection processes and I learned\nto follow the management of the team doing these in the field from the Gant chart.\nPlanning and Field Management Support\nIn this department, I prepared and monitored the work plans of the field teams, as well as\nresource management and logistics planning. Every day, I prepared and evaluated the\nperformance evaluation reports of all teams and employees, and as a result, necessary\ninformation was given to the necessary people, and when necessary, necessary conversations\nwere held with people who were in a very bad situation.\nPlanning and resource management is one of the core areas of industrial engineering and\nthese processes are directly related to increasing productivity and operational improvements.\nThe process of preparing work plans and effectively managing field teams was challenging as\nit required detailed planning.\nI gained practical knowledge and experience in planning and resource management. I\nimproved my performance evaluation and reporting skills.\nNetwork and Technical Operations\nWe examined the working principles of technologies such as ADSL, VDSL, FTTB, FTTC, FTTH.\nWe received many trainings on router and switch configurations, etc.\n13\n\nNetwork management and technical operations directly contribute to system optimization\nand technology integration in industrial engineering.\nIt was interesting to see and learn about new technologies and the basis of technological\nthings that are being renewed and progressing. It was also quite challenging to learn and apply\nthe technical details.\nBut I gained in-depth knowledge about network technologies and equipment.\nDuring my summer internship, the experiences, and observations I gained at TT greatly\nimproved my professional knowledge and skills. From customer service to field operations,\nfrom planning to network management, I reinforced my theoretical knowledge in the field of\nindustrial engineering with practical applications. This process made great contributions to\nme both personally and professionally and was a valuable experience for my future career\ngoals. After such an overview, I will talk a little bit about the terms I learned.\nRouter (Two Wide Area Network (WAN) communications): A router is a network device that\nroutes data packets between two or more networks. Routers enable data communication\nbetween networks by forwarding data packets through the optimal path based on their source\nand destination IP addresses. Two-WAN communication means that a router manages data\ntransmission between two different wide area networks (WANs). This can be used for things\nlike redundancy of internet connectivity or load balancing. Routers are critical to ensuring that\nwide area networks communicate efficiently and reliably.\nF/O (fiber optic): Fiber Optic Cable: Fiber optic cables are made of glass or plastic fibers that\nallow light to pass through them. Fiber optic cables are resistant to electromagnetic\ninterference in data transmission and can transmit large data at high speeds. They are widely\nused in communication and Internet services.\nFTTB (fiber to the building): Fiber to the Building: FTTB is a configuration in which fiber optic\ncable is brought to the basement or telecommunications room of a building. From there, users\ninside the building can access the internet via copper cables or Ethernet cables. This\nconfiguration is common for large buildings such as high-rise apartment buildings and\nbusiness centers.\nFTTC (fiber to the curb): FTTC is a configuration where fiber optic cable is brought to a street\ncorner or a central cabinet. From there, users' homes or businesses are connected with copper\ncable or other types of cabling. FTTC offers a lower-cost solution, while still enabling data\ntransmission at high speeds.\nFTTH (fiber to the home): FTTH is a configuration where fiber optic cable is brought directly\nto the user's home. This offers the fastest internet connection speeds and is one of the most\ntechnologically advanced internet connection methods available today. Users can get the best\nperformance and fastest speeds with this method.\nSwitching Device: A switch is a network device that enables devices within a local area\nnetwork (LAN) to communicate with each other. The switch manages and optimizes network\ntraffic by routing data packets to the correct destination. This ensures efficient and reliable\ndata transmission within the network.\nLAN (Local Area Network): LAN is a type of network in which devices located within a specific\ngeographical area (usually a building or campus) communicate with each other. LAN provides\n14\n\nhigh-speed data transmission and facilitates operations such as file sharing and printer sharing\nbetween devices.\nWAN (Wide Area Network): WAN is a type of network where devices communicate with each\nother over large geographical areas (cities, countries, even continents).

The term “asymmetric” means that the\ndownload speed (download) is higher than the upload speed (upload). ADSL is commonly used\nfor broadband internet connection.\nVDSL (Very High Speed Digital Subscriber Line): VDSL is a DSL technology that offers higher\nspeeds than ADSL. It provides data transmission at very high speeds over short distances. VDSL\nis particularly suitable for applications that require high bandwidth, such as video streaming\nand large file downloads.\nXDSL (Generic Name for DSL Technologies): XDSL is the generic name for DSL technologies and\ncovers different types of DSL such as ADSL, VDSL, SDSL. DSL technologies provide broadband\ninternet connection over telephone lines.\nDSL (Digital Subscriber Line): DSL is a broadband internet technology that provides high-speed\ndata transmission over existing telephone lines. DSL uses telephone lines to provide internet\naccess and does not interfere with phone calls during data transmission.\nSSG (Service Selection Gateway): SSG is a network device that allows users to select and\nconnect to various services from an Internet Service Provider (ISP). SSG performs\nauthentication, authorization, and account management to enable users to use specific\nservices. The device allows users to choose between different speed packages, security\nservices, or other additional services, especially general services.\nHGW (home gateway): An HGW is a device that enables in-home devices to connect to the\nInternet. It usually combines the functions of a modem and a router. The HGW manages\ninternet access for devices within the home and provides a secure network connection.\n• Activity Analysis\nAs an industrial engineer intern, I would like to first talk about the general operation etc. Then\nI will explain the specific activities I have done.\nThe activities performed are the realization of physical and definitional operations of internet,\nfixed home phone, pay phone, IP TV and satellite requests or malfunctions of customers in\nGayrettepe TM area. In short, network operation is performed. The customer reports the\ncustomer's request or malfunction through one of the online call center, office, or dealer\nchannels. The relevant unit creates an order or fault work order. These work orders are\ncontrolled by Türk Telekom systems. And they are reflected on the GANT screens of field\noperation teams. (Figure 7) The management of the Gant screen is carried out by switchboard\nsupervisors. Teams intervene in the works that fall on the Gant screen on their mobile devices.\nThe operation is carried out by ensuring customer satisfaction and uninterrupted operation\nof the network in line with the targets set by the General Directorate. In order for this\noperation to continue without interruption of access, the access engineer and field operation\nengineer provide control, support, material requests, team needs, planning, investment,\n15\n\ninstant solution suggestions and long-term solution suggestions and improvements.\nImprovement studies are carried out. In line with the targets set by the General Directorate,\ndirectorate values are largely monitored by engineers.\nThe main topics in network operation are as follows:\nLocation discovery (identification of nearby access points and determination of routes)\nDetermining the profit and loss pillars of the project budget resulting from the planning and\napproving or rejecting the investment\nCollecting orders for approved projects (Commercial activities)\nCompletion and uninterrupted continuity of the physical connections of the location opened\nto access\nProblematic teams are identified as a result of reporting. The works that are not realized\nwithin the target are questioned, the deficiencies of the team or the aspects that can be\nimproved are identified and interviews and field visits are made with the teams. At the same\ntime, whether the teams are working in accordance with OHS (occupational health and safety)\nstandards is checked by managers through audits. Access systems that malfunction due to\nexternal factors are intervened and the malfunction is eliminated. The aspects that can be\nimproved are addressed and measures are taken to prevent recurrence. Maintenance is\ncarried out periodically in order for the network to run smoothly.\nHow are targets tracked?\nSince all work is carried out through WMS (Workforce Management System - Gant chart),\nreports are shared in excel format using the WMS. Through the systems that WMS\ncommunicates with in the background, raw data-based tracking of targets is carried out.\nWith the calculation methods determined by the General Directorate, the score of each team\nconstitutes the average of the power plants, and the average of the power plants constitutes\nthe average of the directorate. The average of the directorates also constitutes the average\nof the Istanbul regional directorate. As Gayrettepe directorate, the goal is to always be in the\ntop 3. The control of these is followed by the operations manager and engineers.\nHow to work on a GANT screen?\nIn order for the Gant screen to work, first a work area is created. There are 4 work areas\n(Beşiktaş, Gayrettepe, Levent 1 - 2 power plants) for Gayrettepe TM. Team codes are entered\ninto these work areas. The work ability that each code can do is added to each code. In\naddition, the working area of each team code is determined. (neighborhood, street etc.) For\nexample, when a fiber failure occurs, the system first looks at the work area, then the work\narea and finally the team codes with fiber capability in that area. It assigns it to the gant chart\nof the relevant team with an appointment gap in the GANT chart. (Figure 7) The appointment\n",

(Figure 8, figure 9)\nFigure 8. KPI List\nFigure 9\nDuring my one-week internship in the commercial activities department at Türk Telekom, I\nworked in different departments. First, I participated in mobile line and internet sales in\ncorporate customer services. Then, I was involved in modem, internet and Tivibu sales\nprocesses in individual customer services. In the customer satisfaction department, I worked\non after-sales transactions, cancellations, campaign renewals and improving customer\n17\n\nrelations. In the commercial activities management, I worked on team management, sales\nfollow-up, and field visits. During D2D field visits, infrastructure works were carried out in new\nbuildings and the transition processes of existing buildings to fiber infrastructure were\nobserved. In Figure 10, I shared the visuals of a few buildings that I had the chance to directly\nobserve in the field and I wanted to share some information about these buildings.\n“D2D Site Visits:\nNew building (GF) visit\nMecidiyeköy neighborhood Kervangeçmez street No:11 Şişli/Istanbul\nExisting building (BF) visit\nMecidiyeköy neighborhood Atakan street No:6/8 Şişli/Istanbul\nA visit was made to the hotel where Mr. Kaan had worked before. Questions such as “Do you\nneed a free sim card?” were asked. Checks were made.\nTürk ali neighborhood Ihlamur dere street No:130 Beşiktaş/Istanbul– The building was visited\nbut will be visited again as it is in rough condition.\nTürk ali behçetnecatigil neighborhood No:9/11 – The building is in rough condition, it will be\nvisited again in the future.\nOrtaköy bulgurcu street No:21 detached building\nOrtaköy beren street No:15\nOrtaköy urgancı street No:2/4\nNispetiye aytar street No:12\nNispetiye mah. Başar street No:15 – Business cards were made for these buildings.”\nFiber conversion: This is when there is already an existing infrastructure, and a new cable is\nlaid to it and fiber is built. FTTH becomes faster internet. It is done free of charge to existing\ntelecom customers and at the same time, they are trying to attract other operators by\napplying campaigns with these visits.\nFigure 10\nICBC Bank Meeting with Strategic Client Director\nI attended a meeting with ICBC Bank at Türk Telekom Headquarters with Mr. Mehmet Bey,\nStrategic Customer Director. During the meeting, leading firewall solutions such as Palo Alto,\nFayrol, Fortinet and Check Point were discussed. Advanced security and threat prevention\ntechnologies offered by each solution were emphasized. The meeting allowed me to deepen\nmy knowledge in the field of network security and observe the collaboration processes with\nlarge-scale companies.\nField Studies\nThen, with the HAES (External Access Systems) team, we went to the areas with access\nproblems in the field. We restored access in areas with internet outages and requested\n18\n\nsupport from BEDAŞ in areas with power outages. In long-lasting works, we connected\ngenerators and temporarily resolved access problems by providing temporary solutions.\n(Figure 11) These interventions were made to ensure that outages in field cabinets were\nrepaired within a maximum of 12 hours. Throughout the day, we worked to resolve customer\ncomplaints about internet connection problems, address errors and systemic problems.\nSeyrantepe neighborhood Cesur street No:57 in front of the park, a generator was connected\nas the outage exceeded 20 hours.\nFigure 11\nTransition to RSMC Department and Trainings\nFirst, I learned about the role and importance of MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching)\ntechnology in network management at the Gayrettepe switchboard. Then, we received a\ntraining on mobile communication and network management in the Next Generation Network\n(NGN) department at the Türk Telekom Regional Directorate tower building. (Figure 12)\nWithin the scope of this training, the structure, functioning and transmission processes of\nmobile networks were discussed in detail, and I had the opportunity to observe how network\nproblems are detected and solved. In the following days, we received a training titled “Layers\nof Internet” at the RSMC department. In this training, I gained in-depth knowledge about the\nlayered structure of the internet, data transmission processes and interactions between\nlayers. Afterwards, a comprehensive network training was held and network configurations,\ndata traffic management and network security issues were examined in detail.\nFigure 12\nBefore this system existed, 500 people each worked in copper in the power plants and in the\nfields. Voice technology started to develop. After 2017, it became fiber. The number of\nemployees and the number of failures decreased. The number of power plants decreased.\nWhile there was copper in the fields, it started to go to homes with fiber. It became closer and\n19\n\ninternet services started to increase. After 2012, they started to distribute the power plants\nto the streets and the power plants were replaced by msan. Now we are moving to the virtual\npart of ims.\nTransition to Access Team and Operational Studies\nI continued in the access team in field operations management and learned the business\nprocesses and systems used in this department. I took an active role in connection controls\nand fault detection processes in the field. In the access planning unit, first of all, drawings are\nmade for a project both manually in the field and on the computer as in Figure 13, and then\nthe PARS (Project Analysis and Reporting Processes) system is used. This system is used for\nbudget approval and project activation after the completion of project drawings.\nTogether with the access engineer, the cabling works performed by the contractors in the field\nare checked and measured. In addition to this, we made project drawings for Metro Ethernet\nusers by examining the cables and devices installed in the buildings through GIS (Geographic\nInformation System). We calculated the labor and material costs for these projects and\ncalculated the project costs.\nFigure 13. Corporate Projects Planning Interface\nIf I add information about some of the images, I put in Appendix 2, the one in Figure 14 is\nequipment used in the data center or telecommunications field. The devices in the image are\ncalled network switches and routers used for fiber optic, Ethernet cable systems.\nThe devices in Figure 15 (Appendix 2) are telecommunication cabling panels or main\ndistribution frames (MDF). Such devices are usually located in large telecommunication\ncenters or data centers, where many cables are managed, combined, and distributed. It is the\nswitchboard where old-style copper cable routing is done.\n20\n\n3. Conclusions\nDuring my 20-day internship at Türk Telekom, I worked in many different departments from\ncustomer service to field operations and improved myself in this process. The knowledge and\nexperience I gained became very important for me. I had the opportunity to work with the\ncustomer service department in commercial activities, and with the field management\nsupport team, field supervisors, HAES team and Access team in field operations. I also received\ntraining on Next Generation Network (NGN) in the RSMC department at Türk Telekom\nRegional Directorate.\nThanks to these activities, I had the opportunity to closely observe the operational processes\nin the telecommunications sector and understand the dynamics in the sector. My experience\nin the project field has given me a deep understanding of the importance of site management,\nteamwork and infrastructure. When necessary, I use Office applications, TTOYS, KOKPİTT, GIS,\nWMS etc. programs on my computer. By doing this kind of work, I improved my Office\nApplication skills, etc. and gained writing skills by preparing reports based on them. In\ncommercial activities, I observed the critical role of customer satisfaction and service quality\nin the success of the company. I improved my communication skills by observing how to\ncommunicate with customers, etc.\nThe experiences I gained during my internship included system installation and maintenance,\nnetwork management, and customer complaint resolution. These experiences enhanced my\nability to identify problems from an engineering perspective, manage problem-solving\nprocesses, and develop a customer-centric approach. In addition, the working conditions of\nthe engineers I observed in the field showed me the importance of teamwork and constant\ncommunication. However, I observed that there was a problem when the field supervisors\nwere managing the teams in the field. When the team went to the customer appointment\nwritten in the gant chart, there was a lot of failure to reach the customer. And the field\nsupervisors had to run after the customers and reach them many times. This reduced the\nnumber of jobs to be done during the day. Both time was wasted and work was disrupted. For\nthis reason, I thought that if the customer who makes an appointment is not at home at that\ntime, a system of either not being able to make an appointment for 15 days or making a\ncertain amount of payment on the second appointment should be created, and I also talked\nto the authorities to put this into operation.\nDespite its large market size, the telecommunications sector has a dynamic structure that has\nto keep pace with constantly evolving technology. In order to adapt to these rapid changes,\nthe Company continuously follows and implements technological innovations. However, the\nmain challenges in the sector include the cost of infrastructure investments and rapidly\nchanging customer expectations.\nI believe that in the next 5-10 years, technologies such as big data analytics, artificial\nintelligence, the internet of things, and 5G will be increasingly used in the business world and\nproductivity will increase. I also believe that technologies such as 3D printing,\nnanotechnology, and robotics will revolutionize products and services. The integration of\nthese technologies will provide the company with a competitive advantage and encourage\ncustomers to innovate.\n21\n\na. Impact\nThe engineering work I saw during my tenure at Türk Telekom’s RSMC (Network System\nOperations Management - Carrier) department can be related to many situations:\nGlobal Impact:\nDigital Communications and Global Connectivity: Türk Telekom's fiber optic networks and\nbroadband services are part of the global communications infrastructure, accelerating the\nflow of information around the world. This facilitates international cooperation, trade, and\neducation. Furthermore, this infrastructure supports integration into the global digital\neconomy, helping to bridge the digital divide between countries.\nEconomic Impact:\nCost Savings and Efficiency: The use of fiber optic technology speeds up data transmission\nwhile reducing energy costs and maintenance requirements. This could lead to significant\nperformance gains. Türk Telekom’s investment in this area will contribute to Turkey’s\neconomic growth, increasing the popularity of digital services and the country’s\ncompetitiveness.\nEnvironmental Impact:\nEnergy Efficiency and Waste Reduction: Fiber optic cables consume less energy than\ntraditional copper cables, which reduces the company's carbon footprint. In addition, the\nlonger lifespan of these cables also reduces the amount of electronic waste. Türk Telekom's\nenvironmentally friendly engineering solutions contribute to achieving sustainable\ndevelopment goals.\nSocial Impact:\nDigital Inclusion and Social Development: Türk Telekom's broadband services contribute to\nreducing social inequalities by increasing digital access, especially in rural and socio-\neconomically disadvantaged areas. Such services facilitate access to basic services such as\neducation and healthcare, thereby improving the quality of life across society. In addition, the\ncompany's social responsibility projects for the community promote digital literacy,\nencouraging individuals to access and use modern technology.\nb.

One of the most important lessons I learned during this\nprocess is that teamwork is the key to success, even in challenging and unpredictable\nenvironments such as field work.\nc. Self-directed Learning\nDuring my internship at Türk Telekom, I realized how important self-learning and developing\na positive attitude towards lifelong learning are for professional success and personal\ndevelopment. The rapid technological developments and dynamic business environment in\nthe telecommunications sector make it imperative to continuously acquire new knowledge\nand improve existing skills.\nKnowledge and Skills Required for Professional Practices:\nDuring the internship, I felt the need to gain a deeper understanding of telecommunications\ninfrastructure, fiber optic technologies, customer service processes and field operations. As\nan engineer working in the telecommunications field, I realized that these topics are critical\nfor professional practice. Therefore, I tried to expand my knowledge on topics such as fiber\noptic cable connections, signal processing techniques and network management. I also\nfocused on effective communication techniques and problem-solving skills for customer\nsatisfaction.\nAdditional Information Needed to Execute the Project:\nWhile determining the additional knowledge I needed to carry out the projects, I decided to\nlearn various software tools in order to solve the technical problems I encountered in the field\nmore quickly and effectively.
