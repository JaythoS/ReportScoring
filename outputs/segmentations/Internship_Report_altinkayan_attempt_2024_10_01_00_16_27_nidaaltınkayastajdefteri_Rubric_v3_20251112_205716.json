        "content": "Executive Summary\nDHL Supply Chain is a large company that is a global leader in logistics and provides supply\nchain management services. The company specializes in warehousing, transportation, and\ndistribution, focusing on services that meet the specific needs of various industries.\nEngineering activities include optimizing supply chain operations, implementing advanced\ntechnology for automation and effective warehouse management to increase efficiency and\nensure customer satisfaction. During my internship at DHL Supply Chain Warehouse 8, I had\nthe chance to experience the logistics and supply chain sector in all its details. I was in\nassignments where I could gain practical knowledge starting from the very basics. My basic\nresponsibilities and what I learned were as follows:\n- Order Picking: I tried to identify inefficiencies by experiencing the current order picking\nprocesses one-on-one under the leadership of team leaders. During this process, I thought\nand focused more on reducing the travel time of order pickers.\n- Warehouse Layout Planning: I focused on the question of how to make picking methods\neasier based on the order frequency of the products and I did a reading and reinforcement\nstudy on this subject. I dealt with the mapping of the physical layout of the shelves and\nmaking them interpretable on Excel.\n-Data Analysis: I worked on collecting and analyzing data on order processing and\nwarehouse density levels. I also made manual measurements during the data collection\nprocess to have understanding my project better. The data was used for operational\nimprovements. I did all these things on Excel.\n- Project Participation: I took part in a project for the integration of a new Warehouse\nManagement System (WMS). (This project is also the project I had to develop during my\ninternship.) My task was to briefly analyze the current storage and product collection\nprocesses, comment on their shortcomings, and then contribute to making them more\nefficient with feedback.\nMy expectation from my internship is to hands-on experience in supply chain management\nand understand what industrial engineers do in this sector. I was hoping to learn the daily\noperations of a logistics company and apply the knowledge I learned to contribute to real-\nworld projects. My expectations were more than met throughout the internship. I had the\nopportunity to learn this industry in the best way I could. Therefore, I would like to thank\neveryone who helped me in Warehouse 8.\nIn 20 working days, I learned a lot, both in terms of knowledge and practical skills:\n- How warehouse operations are run in a logistics company.\n- The importance of efficient order picking.\n- How to analyze and usage of the data to improve all operations.\n- The importance of warehouse organization to improve flows and reduce waste.\n- What happens during the transition to new applications.\nThis experience significantly broadened my perspective on supply chain management and\nlogistics, which was almost zero. It also improved my problem-solving skills and my ability to\nwork collaboratively in a professional environment. And most importantly for me, it instilled\nin me how to think as an industrial engineer. It increased my interest in my department and\nmy enthusiasm for work.\nFigure 1: DHL Logo",

The origins of Deutsche Post DHL\nGroup date back to 1969 and began with DHL, founded by Adrian Dalsey, Larry Hillblom and\nRobert Lynn. DHL takes its name from the first letters of the surnames of these three\nfounders. Initially offering international air express services and document delivery services,\nDHL has expanded into freight forwarding, logistics and supply chain management. In 2005,\nDeutsche Post acquired Exel plc, a leading logistics company based in the UK, and this\nacquisition expanded DHL Supply Chain's global footprint and services. Its global network\nserves multinational companies with complex supply chain needs, as well as providing\ntailored logistics solutions to regional and local businesses. DHL Supply Chain operates in\nmore than 60 countries around the world, with 2,400 locations, 120,000 logistics experts\nand 23 million m2 of storage space. It provides warehousing, distribution and distribution\nnetwork management services, as well as value-added services such as labeling and\npackaging in the automotive, consumer, retail, technology, healthcare and industrial sectors.\nIn Turkey, it started operating in the field of supply chain and logistics solutions in 2000.\nWith a total of more than 1700 employees and a storage area exceeding 370 thousand m2,\nit offers services such as labeling, packaging, home delivery, spare parts logistics and reverse\nlogistics in addition to storage and distribution services to leading companies in the\nconsumer, retail, health, automotive, industrial production and technology sectors. In Gebze\nWarehouse 8, it provides services in a 29,404 square meter warehouse. Of the 228\nemployees, 120 are full-time warehouse personnel and 3 are industrial engineers.\nWarehouse 8, which has 27 loading and unloading docks and a pallet capacity of 34,500\nunits, has a height of 11.7 meters. There is three largest customers these are Mondelez\nInternational, Nestle and Mars.Optimizing logistics and supply chain management is critical\nto reducing costs, shortening delivery times, and increasing customer satisfaction by\nensuring the efficient delivery of goods and services from suppliers to customers. This sector\nintegrates various activities such as procurement, production, warehousing, transportation,\ndistribution, and reverse logistics (product returns and recycling). In addition to DHL Supply\nChain, other major global players such as UPS Supply Chain Solutions, FedEx Supply Chain,\nKuehne + Nagel, and CEVA Logistics play important roles in this field. There are also regional\ncompanies in the sector that focus on specific geographic regions or specialize in little\nmarkets. Digitalization and sustainability are two important trends in logistics and supply\nchain management. While the adoption of digital technologies such as IoT, artificial\nintelligence, and blockchain are used to increase visibility, predict processes, and optimize\nsupply chain operations; the interest in sustainability initiatives, which are very important in\ntoday's world, such as reducing carbon footprint, optimizing transportation routes, and\nadopting environmentally friendly packaging materials in line with environmental concerns,\nis increasing day by day. As a result, DHL Supply Chain and the broader logistics and supply\nchain industry enable the efficient movement of goods and services across complex supply\nnetworks to support global trade and economic activity. Technological advances and market\ndynamics continue to shape the future of global logistics and supply chain management.\n29.404 sq.m. 27 d ocks 11. 7 m 34.500 1 20 FTE\nloadin g dock Fre e high P allet posit ion Employees\nWarehouse space\nFigure 2: Informations from slide",

At the\nheart of this system are warehouse management and logistics processes, which are critical\nto Mondelez's supply chain. Processes such as goods receipt, inventory management, order\npreparation and shipping constitute the basic components of the service. In order to\nsuccessfully manage these processes, continuous coordination is ensured with departments\nsuch as logistics operations, financial planning, purchasing, customer relations and human\nresources.\nRelationship with Marketing\nThe effectiveness of the services provided by DHL Supply Chain is of great importance in\nterms of increasing customer satisfaction. Working with a large customer such as Mondelez\nin particular requires speed, efficiency and accuracy of logistics processes. The marketing\nteam strengthens the brand value by conveying to customers the information that the\noperations are carried out on time and completely.

        "content": "d. Professional and Ethical Responsibilities of Engineers\nMy observations during my internship confirmed how important the professional and ethical\nresponsibilities of industrial engineers in this company are. First of all, there were 2\nindustrial engineers that I closely observed, including Mehmet Bey, the manager of the\ndepartment where I did my internship. The ethical part is very important, especially in terms\nof efficient and sustainable progress in the operations section and ensuring the motivational\nand quantitative efficiency of the departments. Industrial Engineers are responsible for\nanalyzing every step in the logistics processes. In particular, the optimization of the\nwarehouse layout and product collection processes is one of the issues that engineers\nconstantly think about. As in the current warehouse layout, placing large-volume and high-\nweight products in the most easily accessible places gives positive momentum to the order\npreparation process. They are responsible for evaluating the operations using various\nefficiency indicators and monitoring them. This responsibility is called OMS within DHL\nSupply Chain, and Raşit Ömer Bey, whom I was able to observe in this regard, was a very\nsuccessful engineer. For example, the collection times of the products in the warehouse, the\naccuracy of the shipping processes and the speed of the goods acceptance processes, the\nwork performances of the blue-collar workers in the warehouse are analyzed and awards\nare given according to these performances in certain periods. DHL is a company that\nattaches great importance to digitalization and technological solutions, and as far as I know,\ngives consultancy is also provided on the company. Industrial engineers, warehouse\nmanagement systems (WMS) and automation technologies are the most emphasized\nsubjects in terms of faster and more efficient operation. At the same time, they take an\nactive role in inventory management processes and prevent shortages or excess stocks by\nmonitoring stock levels. They make communication with customers healthier by making\ndemand forecasts and contribute to the smooth progress of shipping programs.\nProfessional and Ethical Responsibilities of Industrial Engineers\nThe ethical part is very important, especially in logistics operations in the food sector\n(Mondelez operations include leading brands in the food sector such as Milka, First, etc.).\nEven the smallest detail (for example, a 0.7 degree drop in temperature) can negatively\naffect many things in operations. In this case, it is about the correct use of data and the\nreporting process. Honest reports are important for the company's overall performance and\ncustomer satisfaction. Not providing misleading or incomplete information is the best\napproach at this point.\nOccupational Safety and Employee Welfare is perhaps the riskiest part of ethical\nresponsibilities. The health and safety of employees should be at the forefront in every\nmatter. Control should be provided for people working under difficult conditions such as\noperations in the warehouse, and occupational health and safety equipment should be\nchecked and updated at certain intervals. During the 1 week that I observed in the\nwarehouse, I observed firsthand that this was given great importance at DHL and that no\nconcessions were made to anyone in this regard. The section at the company entrance\nshowing the number of days without a work accident can be considered a source of\nmotivation for both blue-collar and white-collar employees. Preventing work accidents and\ncreating ergonomic working conditions in warehouses is both a professional and ethical\nresponsibility.\n9\n\nIf I were to classify ethical rules under three headings, the three headings that I was most\ninterested in and happy to observe at DHL were as follows.\nFair and Equal Working Environment: I observed that coworkers and lower-level employees\nwere treated in accordance with this principle of justice and equality and that there was a\nvery healthy motivation in terms of communication. An area where everyone was happy was\ncreated.\nConfidentiality and Reliability: Engineers working at DHL are obliged to keep the company's\ntrade secrets and customer data confidential. Examples of this are that no photos are taken\nin the warehouse, each product has separate codes and not everyone can access these\ncodes, the IT department works meticulously and the warehouse is not entered without\npermission.\nContribution to Society and the Environment: The company expects engineers to act with a\nsense of social responsibility and clearly expresses this. It also attaches great importance to\nthe social life of its employees. The tournaments, workshops and awards they organized this\nsummer are examples of this. In this context, it is very important to develop environmentally\nsensitive projects and they are open to all suggestions from employees who come up with\nprojects that contribute to sustainability goals and support development. Industrial\nengineers not only manage technical processes in large logistics companies such as DHL, but\nalso act with business ethics and social responsibility awareness. They are also responsible\nfor setting an example for other employees.\nFigure 9: Waste bins in the warehouse",

        "content": "2. Summer Practice Description\nDHL Supply Chain 8. I had the chance to observe many things related to my department\nduring my internship at the warehouse. The things I observed were generally about analysis,\noptimization and some operations.\nI had a 1- week training and application process for the process analysis and optimization\npart and during this process I observed everything about logistics. It was about monitoring\nthe flow from the warehouse to the shipment of products and how processes can be\noptimized, what employees do, what they complain about and how solutions can be\nproduced.\n- In the inventory management part, I matched the information I got from the book\nWAREHOUSE & DISTRIBUTION SCIENCE that I read before starting my main job in my\n10\n\ninternship, using the Warehouse Management System (WMS) to monitor stock levels and\nhow to analyze the frequency of product movements. I observed how shift employees\ncontrol this, which RF systems they use and even how they control the process with RF and\nhow these are processed in the SAP system.\n- Quality control: Inspecting incoming products and documenting deviations in product\nquality.\n- Data analysis: Creating pivot tables using Excel and other tools, analyzing shipment data\nand determining trends.\n- Lean operations: Conducting studies on reducing waste in processes by observing the\nimplementation of lean production principles.\nThe tasks I performed were closely related to the operations research, manufacturing\nsystems, and probability and statistics courses I took in my department. For example,\nprocess optimization and data analysis were directly related to the techniques I learned in\nthe operations research course, while inventory management was related to the\nmanufacturing course. The subject of inventory management was quite interesting to me\nbecause it was a topic that affected all stages of supply chain operations. The most\nchallenging part was ensuring the accuracy of the data in the shipment records, because\neven a small mistake could negatively affect stock levels and order fulfillment and restart the\nentire process. To prevent this, it is tracked both manually and in the system, and products\nare counted repeatedly if necessary, which is one of the processes that complicates these\noperations.\nFirst of all, this internship introduced me to a sector that I was previously quite distant from\nand showed me how enjoyable, dynamic and open-ended the sector was and how important\nan operation experience I gained. It was a month that I was very involved with Excel and\nreally tried to learn logistics in all its details. I gained in-depth knowledge about warehouse\nmanagement and operational processes. I especially observed how important the\nwarehouse layout and new shelving systems were in increasing the efficiency of operations.\nThe new shelving system allowed products to be found more easily and processed quickly,\nwhich was a very important development both in terms of time management and labor\nefficiency, and the fact that this layout was made thanks to my project motivated me even\nmore. I also worked on how products were placed on the shelves, which products waited in\nstock for how long, and the optimization of these processes, and I interpreted and visualized\nthese studies clearly on Excel. During this process, I learned how important it is to regularly\ncontrol stock entries and exits, especially in controlling the expiration dates of products, and\nthat in addition to weight, size and stock, expiration dates are also important in the shelving\nsystem. Paying attention to the expiration date of products, especially for Mondelez, plays a\ncritical role in terms of customer satisfaction and preventing losses. Another important\ndetail I learned during my internship was how sales of certain products change seasonally.\nAs a result of the analyses I made, I noticed that especially candy and chocolate products\nwere sold more in certain months. For example, candy showed a significant increase during\nreligious holidays, while I observed that chocolate sales increased especially in September.\nThis data would be an important reference for future sales forecasts and stock management.\nThanks to these experiences, I better understood the importance of warehouse\norganization, stock control and sales trends in workflow. I had the chance to put the\ninformation I learned theoretically into practice in operational processes.",

        "content": "The engineering activity that I observed and was a part of during my internship was a racking\nsystem optimization aimed at more efficient placement of products in the warehouse and\nimprovement of stock management. This project aimed to make the placement of products\n11\n\nand stock control processes faster, more accurate and systematic, and shortened the\noperation time, provided energy efficiency and reduced costs.\nThe main task I had to do was to review the existing shelf system within the warehouse\nlayout and create a new shelf layout plan. In this context:\n- Placing the products according to demand intensity,\n- Separating the products into specific areas according to their expiration dates,\n- It was planned to position the shelves according to the distance to the shipping area in a\nway that would reduce time loss during loading and unloading processes.\n- The weight of the products and the area they cover were also taken into consideration\nduring all this planning.\nDuring the internship process, I observed that placing products that are particularly in high\ndemand and run out in a short time closer to the pick points both saved time and allowed\nfor more efficient use of labor.\nThe main performance indicators and observations taken into consideration during this\nprocess were as follows:\n- Warehouse processing times: The times when products enter and exit the warehouse were\nmeasured. After the shelf arrangement, it was observed that there was no shortening of the\nprocessing time with pickers and forklifts, especially for frequently sold products, but there\nwas a shortening in the part where they go to the shipping area with the new shelf system.\n- Stock accuracy: Thanks to the new shelf system, the placement of products in the right\nplaces and the acceleration of stock controls increased stock accuracy. While this process\nwas carried out via devices called RF and SAP in Nestle operations, it was carried out as Excel\nand manual entry in Mondelez operations.\n- Workforce efficiency: Optimizing the shelf layout shortened the times when employees\nfound and placed products, thus increasing the efficiency of the workforce.\nAnalysis and Problematic Issues\nAs a result of all the observations made, it was determined that the part where engineers\nand blue-collar employees working in the operation had the most problems was spending\ntoo much time, the best-selling products on the shelves being far from the shipping points\nand in irrelevant places, and empty pallets being in irrelevant places. The lack of correctly\npositioned pick points was a situation that slowed down the operation.\nIt was observed that products on the shelves should be sorted according to their expiration\ndate, weight, and order density, but this practice was not done systematically, and some\nproducts were randomly placed according to the gaps on the shelves. As a result, it was\nhighlighted that some products could not be sold on time during certain periods, and this\nsituation caused excess stock, empty pallets, and shelves.\nWith the data I received from the warehouse management system (WMS), I concluded that\ninefficiencies in warehouse layout extended order fulfillment times. To correct this situation,\nI designed a project to implement a regional picking strategy that would reduce unnecessary\nmovements of employees and make the picking process more fluid.\n12\n\nWarehouse Shelving System Optimization\nThe engineering activity that I observed and actively participated in during my internship\nwas to optimize the shelf system and product placement of the storage Mondelez in the\nwarehouse. This project that I focused on aimed to increase the speed and efficiency of\nwarehouse operations.\nDetailed Description of the Project\nAs part of this project, I periodically analyzed the order quantities of the products given to\nme in Excel. As a result of this analysis, I determined which products received more orders in\ncertain periods. After examining the order quantities and periodic changes, I created a\nwarehouse map that shows which shelves the products in the warehouse were located on. I\nadded the order quantities to the map and visualized the areas where the orders were\nconcentrated with a colored map using conditional formatting. In this way, I was able to\ndetermine which shelves had the most picking operations.\nFigure 10: Location of products in the warehouse before editing on Excel\nAs a result, I observed that the areas where the picking operations were most concentrated\nwere far from the pick points and shipping areas. To solve this situation, I developed a new\nshelf layout proposal that suggested placing products with high order volumes in more easily\naccessible points. In this project , I used the information in Chapter 6 of the Warehouse &\nDistribution Science book.\nPerformance and Data\nThe key performance indicators I considered during this activity were as follows:\n- Picking Time: I analyzed the picking time of high-demand products with the current layout.\nI noticed that this time took an average of 20% longer during peak order periods.\n- Order Accuracy: It was observed that the current shelving system caused confusion and\nthat some orders were picked incorrectly.\n- Labor Efficiency: I observed that employees spent more time in the warehouse due to the\nmessy shelving layout, and this situation reduced labor efficiency to a certain extent.\n13\n\nFigure 11: Excel worksheet that I worked in about detail of the products\nCurrent Problematic Issues\nBased on the data I analyzed, I determined that one of the biggest problems in the\nwarehouse layout was that products in high demand were positioned far from picking and\nshipping points. This situation both extended processing times and caused employees to\nexert extra effort. In addition, the disorder between the shelves caused orders to get mixed\nup and the wrong products to be picked.\nPoints Requiring Improvement and Alternative Solution Suggestions\nIn this context, the need to restructure the shelf layout emerged. Moving products in high\ndemand to more strategic locations within the warehouse and bringing them closer to the\npicking points could speed up the process. After developing this proposal, I reviewed the\nrelevant literature and examined different approaches to picking time optimization and\nwarehouse layout design. I learned that systems called slotting, where products are placed\naccording to demand density, are successful in such warehouse operations. As a result of\nthis literature review, I evaluated that the slotting method is applicable to make the shelf\nlayout I suggested more effective.",

        "content": "3.Conclusions\nDuring my time at DHL Supply Chain, I gained a lot of experience in observing how things work\nin the logistics sector and understanding both the theoretical and practical operations of the\nsector. During this time, I was worked in the logistics processes of Mondelez International.\nActivities I Performed During the Internship\n14\n\nDuring the internship, I took part in every stage of logistics operations. By analyzing storage\nprocesses, I observed how products were accepted, stored and collected in line with orders,\nand from time to time I took part in this process. I was involved in projects to increase the\nefficiency of these processes. In particular, I worked on a project to optimize the layout of the\nmost demanded products in the warehouse. Within this scope, I analyzed the order density\nof the products and suggested that those in high demand be moved to shelves closer to the\nshipping point and pick points. I prepared various reports using Excel and data analysis tools\nand presented these reports.It was how large and how logistics processes serve more than\none area. I realized that a logistics operation does not only mean that products leave the\nwarehouse and reach the customer, but also that every stage of this process requires detailed\nanalysis and optimization. Analyzing and reporting data using Excel and showing how\noperations can be improved has been one of the most important professional gains of mine.\nIndustrial engineers and other technical teams working at DHL were constantly taking an\nactive role in the field to ensure that operations proceed smoothly. Observing the engineers'\nefforts to make continuous improvements in areas such as warehouse layout planning,\ninventory management and demand forecasting was inspiring for me and I think this is one of\nthe most enjoyable aspects of our profession. In addition, taking part in every stage to bridge\nthe gap between field operations and technical operations has added a lot to me.\nCurrent Status of the Logistics Sector and the Challenges It Faces\nLogistics is a fastly growing and increasingly complex sector in the world. Along with growth,\nthere are various challenges. An example of this is increasing customer expectations. Fast\ndelivery demands and multi-channel distribution networks increase the complexity of\noperational processes. The sector also struggles with uncertainties regarding locations of\ncustomers. DHL must and continue to invest in digital technologies and continuously improve\ntheir processes to meet these challenges.\nFigure 12: Digitalization targets\nChanges in the Industry in the Future\nIn the next years, artificial intelligence, big data analytics, the Internet of Things (IoT) and\nautonomous vehicle technologies will come to the forefront, as in every industry. This will\nreduce logistics costs and shorten delivery times. Artificial intelligence will play a major role,\nespecially in demand forecasting, route optimization and warehouse management. From a\n15\n\nsustainability perspective, it is essential to increase initiatives to reduce the carbon footprint,\nbecause logistics is a sector that has a very negative impact on the world in terms of energy\nconsumption, packaging waste and manpower and must be intervened.",

Impact\nDuring my internship at DHL Supply Chain, my observations allowed me to see how the\nlogistics sector can create global, economic, environmental and social impacts.\nGlobal Impact: Optimization in logistics affects international trade in terms of cost and\noperational speed. During my internship, the project I carried out to increase the efficiency\nof the storage and distribution of Mondelez products, as well as the inspection teams and\ncustomers from European countries, helped me to observe and make this conclusion.\nEconomic Impact: Of course, improving storage and shipping processes is one of the parts\nthat increase the profit margins of companies the most. The solution based on the new shelf\nlayout and intensive collection areas can help reduce operational costs and ensure that\nproducts are in the right place at the right time. This increases customer satisfaction and\nalso increases the company's competitiveness.\nEnvironmental Impact: Every environmental project carried out in logistics operations will be\nvery effective because waste and energy spent are at a very high level. More effective\nplanning can help reduce carbon emissions, which in turn reduces the environmental impact\nof the logistics sector.\nFigure 13: Decarbonization targets\nSocial Impact: Ensuring that products reach customers faster means better service. Delivery\nprocesses, especially for basic consumer goods and food products, definitely increase social\nbenefits.",

Teamwork\nDuring my internship, teamwork played a key role in the success of logistics operations.\nWhile working at DHL Gebze Warehouse 8, I had the opportunity to collaborate with people\nfrom various fields of expertise and observe team dynamics. I worked particularly with the\noperations manager, shift manager, stock control officer and warehouse workers.\nMy operations manager is responsible for the overall management of daily processes and\nsupervised the efficiency of the Mondelez International operations in Warehouse 8. The\nshift manager managed the distribution of tasks among the teams within the warehouse,\nensuring that daily operations proceeded smoothly. The stock control officer have an\nimportant role in the layout of the products and stock tracking. The products receiving,\nstorage, order preparation and shipping teams ensured product movements within the\nwarehouse.\nI analyzed the warehouse layout and order picking processes. and the data to identify areas\nwhere picking operations were particularly intense and suggested a more effective\nwarehouse layout plan. During the internship, each team member contributed in their own\narea of expertise and ensured that the operations flows successfully. This team work greatly\ncontributed to the development of me and also my manager's suggestions for making\nwarehouse operations more efficient.\nAs a result, operational changes were achieved balanced use of expertise and collaboration\nwithin the team.

        "content": "During my internship at DHL Supply Chain, I realized that learning on my own was very\nimportant. The fast-moving logistics environment showed me that I needed to be active in\nfinding new information and improving my skills. I saw that I needed more knowledge about\nthings like warehouse management, logistics processes, and data analysis to be more helpful\nin my tasks.\nAt the beginning, I noticed that I didn’t fully understand how to design a good warehouse\nlayout or how the order picking process worked. To improve, I started reading the book\n*Warehouse & Distribution Science*, which helped me learn more about the theory behind\nwarehouse design and inventory movement. I then tried to connect what I read to what I\nsaw in the warehouse. For example, I used tools like Excel’s pivot tables and conditional\nformatting to analyze the data I gathered. This helped me identify areas in the warehouse\nwhere workers could be used more effectively, especially in busy parts of the order picking\nprocess.\nMy main goal was to understand logistics better so I could make suggestions that would\nreally make a difference. I didn’t just rely on what I saw at work — I also did research on\ntopics like artificial intelligence, data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) to see how\nthese new technologies could improve warehouse management. I learned how AI could help\npredict future demand or how IoT could track products in the warehouse in real time. This\nresearch gave me a better understanding of how the warehouse could use new technologies\nto work more efficiently.\nTalking to my colleagues was also a big part of my learning process. I asked for feedback\nfrom the warehouse manager, the shift manager, and other team members to make sure I\nwas on the right track. Their advice helped me see the logistics process more clearly and\nmade my ideas better. For example, when I shared my suggestions about warehouse layout,\ntheir comments helped me think about whether my ideas would actually work in the real\nworld.\nOne important thing I learned is that combining theory and real-world experience is key. I\ncould learn a lot from books and online resources, but I also needed to understand the day-\nto-day challenges from the people working in the warehouse. By listening to them, I\nadjusted my ideas to make sure they were realistic and useful.\nOverall, this internship showed me that learning on my own is important, not just for now,\nbut for my future career. The logistics field is always changing, and I learned that if I want to\nkeep up, I have to keep learning about new technologies and market trends. This experience\nhelped me grow both personally and professionally. I now know that self-learning is not only\nabout improving my work performance but also about being ready for future challenges.\nWhether through studying or learning from others, I understand that continuous learning is\nthe key to success.",
