I had the opportunity to observe the wide-ranging effects of the industrial\nengineering discipline in the retail sector, and these experiences formed a solid foundation\nfor my career.\n• Activity Analysis\nAn important Industrial Engineering activity that I observed during my internship was an\nanalysis study conducted to improve the sales performance of the e-commerce platform.\nThis study included both data analysis and strategic decision-making processes, and I had\nthe opportunity to apply the information I learned during my internship. A study was\nconducted in the e-commerce department in order to analyze the performance of products\nby examining sales data for a certain period of time. This study covered the collection,\nanalysis and reporting of sales data separated by product categories. Firstly, sales data were\ncollected from various sources; these data included periodic sales figures, customer\nfeedback and inventory levels.\nFigure 7: Audience overview example\n12\n\nAfter the data collection process, visualization tools such as Power BI were used for\nthe analysis of the data. Thanks to these tools, we have made it more understandable by\nvisualizing sales trends, best-selling products and customer preferences. In the light of\nthe obtained data, strategic recommendations were made by determining which\nproducts received more attention and which categories remained weak.\nAt this event, some important performance indicators and metrics used to evaluate sales\nperformance were as follows:\nSales Volume: The number of products sold in a certain period of time (for example,\nmonthly or yearly). This indicator is critical for understanding increases or decreases\nin certain product groups, as well as overall performance.\nConversion Rate: A rate that shows how many of the users who visit the website have\nmade a purchase. This ratio is important for evaluating the effectiveness of marketing\nstrategies.\nAverage Order Value (AOV): Determines the average purchase amount made by a\ncustomer. This indicator is used to analyze the impact of the work done to increase\ncustomer spending.\nInventory Turnover Rate: It is a criterion that shows how long it took for stocks to be\nsold. It helps to identify slow-moving products.\nFigure 7: Flo Group in E-commerce\n13\n\nSome problems that arose during the data analysis helped us to better understand the\ncurrent situation. Firstly, in the analyses, it was seen that although some products were\nin high demand, the stock levels remained insufficient. This situation leads to lost sales\nopportunities and negatively affects customer satisfaction. In addition, it was\ndetermined that the conversion rate among website visitors was low. Dec, this may be\ndue to problems that may be related to the user experience. It was concluded that the\nsite design, navigation or paying processes should be reviewed. Finally, the analysis\nresults showed that certain product categories have not kept up with Sunday trends. It\nwas noticed that it was insufficient to respond to the new fashion trends. This situation\nincreases the risk of losing the competitive advantage.\nThis event was an im",

Conclusions\nIf I summarize the activities I carried out during my internship; I worked in various\ndepartments such as logistics, marketing, performance analysis, category\nmanagement and internal audit. During this period, I gained in-depth knowledge\nabout stock management, product planning, sales performance analysis and supply\nchain processes. I also worked on how business processes are optimized with ERP and\nSAP systems. I gained experience in category management in terms of creating\ncollections in line with product and customer demands and developing marketing\nstrategies.\nThanks to these activities, I learned how operational processes work and how each\ndepartment contributes to these processes. At the same time, I developed my skills\nin using software and systems that play important roles in data analysis, planning and\nstrategic decision-making processes. I gained experience in increasing the efficiency\nof processes, especially by using SAP and ERP systems. In addition, I learned to use\nmarketing analysis tools such as customer segmentation and sales performance\nmonitoring effectively.\nIn terms of professional and technical experience, I gained significant gains in data-\ndriven decision-making, teamwork, supply chain optimization and project\nmanagement. The industrial engineers I observed were working in many different\ndepartments such as production, marketing, purchasing and logistics and playing key\nroles in these processes. The versatile skills of the engineers contributed to the\nsmooth flow of workflows and rapid decision-making. The work environment was\ngenerally dynamic, collaborative and innovative; communication between\ndepartments was strong and it was motivating to see everyone working towards a\ncommon goal.\nWhen I examined the status of the sector, I observed that digitalization was rapidly\nincreasing in large companies such as FLO Group and investments in technology were\ngaining importance. ERP systems are of critical importance in supply chain\nmanagement. However, one of the most important challenges for companies\noperating in a large sector is to keep up with rapidly changing consumer demands and\ntechnological developments. The market size and number of employees are\nincreasing every year, but this also brings new challenges in terms of cost and\nefficiency.\nI predict that there will be some major changes in the shoe and fashion retail sector\nin the next 5-10 years. With the widespread use of 3D printers, there may be\nrevolutionary developments in areas such as rapid prototyping of products and even\ndirect-to-consumer customization. Big data analytics and artificial intelligence will\nallow for more accurate forecasting of customer demands and more efficient\ninventory management. In addition, thanks to the Internet of Things (IoT) technology,\ntracking of products in stores can become smarter and real-time inventory\nmanagement can be possible. In terms of environmental sustainability, new materials\nsuch as carbon nanotubes can lead to lighter, more durable and more\nenvironmentally friendly products in production. The integration of artificial\nintelligence and robotics into production processes can increase the efficiency of the\nworkforce and lead to lower costs. In short, the sector will experience radical changes\nin the next decade with digitalization and technological innovations.\n15\n\na. Impact\nThe global, economic, environmental and social impacts of engineering solutions are quite\nextensive, and these impacts were clearly seen in the activities and processes I observed\nduring my internship. The retail sector is one of the areas where we can directly observe the\nimpacts of engineering solutions, especially in logistics, category management and\nproduction processes. Below, I will detail the impacts of these solutions in four main\ndimensions.\nGlobal Impact:\nDuring my internship, I had the opportunity to observe how global trade is managed thanks\nto FLO Group's wide access to international markets. In particular, logistics and supply chain\nprocesses ensure that global trade is managed sustainably and efficiently. Engineering\nsolutions play an important role in improving and optimizing these processes. The faster,\nmore cost-effective and less resource-intensive transportation of products globally increases\nthe competitiveness of companies while also contributing to the development of global\ntrade. In these processes, global supply chain processes can be managed more effectively by\nusing software such as SAP and NOVA and data analysis techniques. In addition, engineering\nsolutions such as digitalization and automation allow for a faster and more flexible\nproduction and distribution network to be established in global markets.\nEconomic Impact:\nEngineering solutions are constantly developed to reduce companies' operational costs and\nincrease efficiency. During my internship, I observed how performance analyses and process\nimprovement studies contribute to the company's cost savings and increased profit margin.\nFor example, inventory costs can be minimized, and product sales performance can be\nincreased thanks to category management and stock optimization studies. Such engineering\nsolutions play an important role in terms of economic growth and sustainability. In addition,\nmaking business processes more efficient using industrial engineering techniques provides a\ncompetitive advantage in the market and contributes to the creation of an economically\nsustainable structure. Cost optimization, efficient use of resources and process\nimprovements directly affect the company's overall economic performance.\nEnvironmental Impact:\nEngineering solutions also have a great impact in terms of environmental sustainability. FLO\nGroup's interest in sustainability projects shows that environmental awareness is increasing,\nand the company is turning to environmentally friendly solutions. Energy efficiency-focused\nsolutions, especially used in logistics processes, aim to reduce the carbon footprint.\nEngineering solutions such as determining energy-saving routes in product transportation\nprocesses or using recyclable packaging materials contribute significantly to reducing\nenvironmental impacts. At the same time, minimizing waste and increasing recycling rates\nwith the technologies used in production processes also contribute to environmental\nsustainability. The role of industrial engineering in these processes is to optimize processes\nto reduce environmental impacts and to develop environmentally friendly solutions.\n16\n\nSocial Impact:\nEngineering solutions also significantly affect social life. Since the retail sector serves a wide\ncustomer base, the social impact of processes developed with engineering solutions is quite\nlarge. The fact that products reach consumers at more affordable prices, faster and with\nhigher quality is a factor that directly affects living standards. In addition, transformations\nare taking place in the labor market with the increase in digitalization and automation\nprocesses. The improvements made by industrial engineers in processes reduce the\nworkload of employees and provide a more efficient and healthier working environment. At\nthe same time, thanks to these solutions, more efficient use of social resources is ensured\nand social responsibility projects that provide feedback to society are supported.\nAs a result, the global, economic, environmental and",
