Summer Practice Description\nDuring the summer practice, a series of detailed activities were carried out,focusingonthe\nanalysis and optimization of the Turkish electricity market. The primary task involved\nextensive data retrieval and analysis using advanced technicaltoolsandmethodologies.The\nhourly electricity price and demand data were collected from the EPIAS Transparency\nPlatform, providing the foundational dataset for the optimization models. This data was\nprocessed and analyzed using Python and various data analysis libraries, including Pandas,\nNumPy, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels. These tools wereinstrumentalinperformingstatistical\nanalyses, calculating descriptive statistics, detecting outliers, and exploring trends and\nseasonality within the data series. The results from these analyses helped in understanding\nthemarketdynamicsandidentifyingkeyfactorsthatinfluenceelectricitypricesanddemand.\nOptimization models were developed using Python’s Pulp library, which facilitated the\ncreation of mathematical models to optimize the generation schedules of power plants.\nThese models incorporated various constraints, such as operational limits of the plants,\nmarket conditions, and regulatory requirements. The implementation of these constraints\nallowed the simulation of realistic scenarios, ensuring that the generation profiles were not\nonly optimal but alsofeasibleundergivenconditions.ThePulplibrarywasparticularlyuseful\nin formulating linear and mixed-integer programming problems, which were essential for\nmaximizing asset value byaligninggenerationscheduleswithmarketprices.SQL-basedtasks\nwere also a significant component oftheinternship,involvingdataextraction,manipulation,\nand analysis to support decision-making processes.

The integration of SQL with Pythonallowedforaseamless\nflow of data between analysis and modeling, enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the\noptimizationoutcomes.\n8\n\nThe tasks performed were closely relatedtoDataAnalyticsEngineering,astheyinvolvedthe\napplication of engineering principles in data analysis, optimization modeling, and process\nimprovement.Theworkwasdirectlylinkedtothecoresubjectsofthemajor,suchassystems\nanalysis, operations research, and data management, providing a practical context for\ntheoretical knowledge acquired during academic studies. The experience of applying these\nconcepts to real-world problems in the energy sector made the work both interesting and\nchallenging. The opportunity to work with actual market data and develop models that\nreflect the complexities of energy production scheduling was particularly engaging, as it\nrequired critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Throughout the internship, significant\nlearning and professional growth were achieved.

This problem\ncan be classifiedasaMixed-IntegerLinearProgramming(MILP)problemduetotheinclusion\nofintegerconstraints,suchastheminimumoperatinghoursforcoalpowerplants,combined\nwith linear relationships between variables. The objective of the model, as represented by\nequation (1), was to maximize the total asset value by summing the generation outputs\nacross all power plants and time intervals. Equation (2) defined the requirement that the\ntotal electricity generation from all power plants at each hour must meet thefixeddemand\nof 1500 MW. This constraint ensured that supply matched the hourly demand throughout\nthe entire period. Equation (3) imposed a restriction on the hydroelectric power plants,\nlimiting their operation to a maximum of 80 hours perweek.Thisconstraintwasspecifically\napplied to the hydroelectric plants (A and E) to account for their operational limitations.\nEquation (4) ensured that the energy produced by each power plant did not exceed its\nmaximum capacity, linking the generation output to the plant’s capacity and operational\nstatus. Equation (5) required each power plant to generate electricity above its minimum\ngeneration level whenever it was in operation. This constraint ensured that all plants\noperatedefficientlywithintheirminimumandmaximumthresholds.\nAdditional constraints were applied to the coal power plant (B) as represented inequations\n(6), (7), and (8). Equation (6) required the coal power plant to operate for at least 12\nconsecutive hours once it was started, reflecting its operational constraints.

Equation (8) ensured that if the coal power plant was started, it would\nremain operational for a minimum of 12 hours,therebyenforcingtheconsecutiveoperation\nrequirement. The variables used in these equations included the energy produced by each\npower plant at a given time, the capacity of each plant, and binary variables indicating\nwhether a plant was operating, starting up, or shutting down at any given hour. This\ncomprehensive formulation accurately captured the operational constraints of the power\nplants while optimizing the overall asset value.ThemodelwasimplementedinPythonusing\nthe Pulp library, effectively optimizing the generation schedule under the defined\nconstraints.\n13\n\nFigure10.ConstraintsAppliedintheOptimizationModelforPowerPlantGeneration\nScheduling.\nThe dataset used in the optimization model was sourced from the EPIAS Transparency\nPlatform, which provides hourly electricity prices, known as Market Clearing Prices (MCP).\nThis dataset as shown in Figure 10 was then converted into a PandasDataFrame(plant_df),\nwhich servedastheprimaryinputfortheoptimizationmodel.Theoptimizationproblemwas\ndefined using the pulp.LpProblem function, with the objective of maximizing asset value,\nwhich was labeled as \"Maximize_Asset_Value.\" Two sets of decision variables were\nintroduced: generation and is_operating. The generation variable was continuous and\nrepresented the amount of electricity generated by each power plant for each hour, while\nthe is_operating variable was binary, indicating whether a power plant was operational\nduring a given hour. The objective function was constructed to maximize the asset value,\ncalculated as the difference between the Market Clearing Price (MCP) and the production\ncost, multiplied by the generated electricity. This was implemented using the pulp.lpSum\nfunction, which summed the contributions of each power plant across all hours. Themodel\ndemonstrated the practical application of mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)\ntechniques in optimizing power plant scheduling, effectively balancing operational\nconstraintswitheconomicobjectives.\nFigure11.HourlyGenerationProfilesofEachPowerPlantandtheTotalDemandTarget\n(MW).\nFigure 11 shows the hourly production schedule of each power plant from December 25,\n2023, to December 31, 2023.

One of the most important\ncomponents of self-directed learning was the capacity to troubleshoot and solve problems\non one's own, which allowed for continuous development without heavily depending on\noutside assistance. In addition to technical training, accessing industry reports, official\ndocumentation, and tutorials related to the energy market played an important role in\nunderstanding the broader context of the data. Interpreting electricity price patterns and\ndemand variations within the market's regulatory framework needed the use of this\ninformation. Professional communication with colleagues and mentors also provided\nimportant support, especially in gaining insights into energy market regulations and the\noperationalaspectsofpowergenerationoptimization.\nThe internship's project based framework developed significant mindsets such as\ndetermination, adaptability, and a proactive approach to problem solving.
