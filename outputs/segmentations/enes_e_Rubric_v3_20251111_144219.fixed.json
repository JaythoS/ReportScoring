        "content": "utive Summary\nIn the course of my internship at iCredible Technologies, I obtained numerous experience in\nsoftware development methodologies. I was able to work on projects with technologies I've\nnever even touched and get a feel for how things are done in a team environment. This\nexperience gave me more than just technical skills, but what it means to work in business and\nwith a team.\nMy internship lasted five weeks. In this period I attempted to comprehend team members and\nderived from their standpoints. I also did heavy work for the project I had been assigned. I\ndeveloped a company’s CSMS as part of the project. The process was intense and incredibly\ncool.\nWeek 1 I spent the whole week researching what technologies I would have to use. I had\ntechnologies that I never tried before, like. NET, Docker, Postman, and DBeaver. I presented\nthese tools briefly in front of my mentor, and I remembered by doing that I was also reviewing\nthose tools.\nI started the 2nd week working exclusively on the main design of my project. I also wireframed\nthe pages with Figma, made my database schema and set up all API endpoints. This step was\nto get the nuts and bolts of this project in place.\nAfter the third week I started with front-end development. I faced with different problems on\nevery step of this way, but my mentor always help me to solve it. This really illustrated the value\nof problem solving ability, knowing when to ask the right questions, and the importance of clear\ninternal communication.\"\nIn the fourth week, I started developing the backend. I used .NET for the backend and\nPostgreSQL for the database. Since this was my first time doing both, I struggled at times.\nWorking with my mentor to solve problems not only shortened my learning curve but also gave\nme real-world experience managing a professional work environment with a collaborator.\nI integrated the frontend and backend modules and completed my project last week. I learned a\nlot about integrating the frontend and backend, and I witnessed how the created file structures\nand DTOs facilitated communication. This process helped me understand the importance of\ncombining various components to create a complete system.\nThis internship allowed me to experience implementing technologies I had never used before\nand significantly contributed to my technical development. How an application should be\nplanned, the frontend, backend, and database structure, and doing everything myself, taught\nme a lot about the entire project.\n1\n\nThis gave me a better understanding of the interconnectedness of the t",

I made sure to allocate additional time for my personal project\nto gain a deeper understanding of these tools. I explored the documentation, leveraged the\ninternet, carried out mini-projects, and maintained communication with my mentor. These\nspaced out efforts helped me understand and utilize the technologies to the project.\nAppendix 1: Daily Activity Tables\n8\n\nDay 1:\nWhen I 1st started at my new company, the team all went out of their way to greet me and meet\neveryone. My supervisor gave me a nice run-down of what an internship at this organisation\nlooks like and the responsibilities for my role. I got a sense of the company culture, their values\nand how various departments work together to meet common goals. That orientation set a really\ngood tone for how I could come into the workplace and gave me confidence about what to\nexpect in the coming weeks.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n16.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\nDay 2:\nMy mentor and I went through the internship papers on day two. We also went through the\nduties, expectations and milestones, I must achieve throughout my internship. This procedure\ncleared up all formal and procedural issues, and my advisor also helped me answer some of the\nquestions I had about how project work is carried out. The co-review process worked to make\nsure I was well aware of my obligations and development path during the internship.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n17.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n9\n\nDay 3:\nAnd here my teacher gave me about 15 things that I had to go research and present. All day\ngetting together this presentations, looking information for I can see the technology and project\nneeds. Later on, I presented what I found out to my teacher. This became a good opportunity for\nme to improve communication with more experienced coworkers and gain confidence in\nspeaking technical terms.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n18.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\nDay 4:\nThe fourth day was just for me to do some research intro the tech I would be working with. I\ncompared a number of development environments and frameworks, including what type they\nwhere, pros/cons, and typical purpose. I pick up a bunch of stuff about React. This feasibility\nstudy enabled me to, and facilitated practical application.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n21.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n10\n\nDay 5:\nThen I learned even more about things, i.e. read documentation, etc, from the day before. I also\nshared my learnings with my mentor to confirm my decisions and get guidance on idioms. When\ni said my idea I had a clearer concept on the mind. This form of high level preliminary design\nresearch is crucial to establish a good base of knowledge, before hardened development\nbegan.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n22.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\nDay 6:\nI spent the day trying to clear up the project idea. I started by having an in-depth discussion with\nmy mentor to establish the basic functionality of the application, what kind of user roles would\nbe involved and how it would flow. By talking through use cases, I developed a click-through\nuser flow for users signing in to the system and device management. I did also taken into\naccount when making the decision, functional and non-functional requirements (non-functional\nones such as performance and usability). I also outlined the preliminary system architecture and\ndetermined which components would be focused on initially. For instance, I put together a\nsimple architecture diagram that outlined exactly how the front-end, the back-end, database and\nAPI would communicate. This was key for accelerating the development phases and working in\na more organized and predictable manner.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n23.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n11\n\nDay 7:\nThen I went onto designing the front end. First step was I searched for a pre-made Figma\ndesign and adjusted it to fit my project. I took care of UI, the look and feel of main screens such\nas homepage, device management (room), room management itself and profile page.\nThroughout the process, I took into account UI/UX principles such as accessibility-friendly color\ncontrasts, sensible icon placement, and friendly transitions. I would also go over the designs\nwith my mentor for input. He liked the design in general and that I was methodical.\nFigure 2: Figma design Figure 3: Figma design\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n24.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n12\n\nDay 8:\nI type of continued from yesterday, working on the design of the admin panel. I have used a\nsimilar visual language to remain consistent with the user side designs, but from admin side\nthere are extra permissions and different functions. For instance, I developed separate module\nfor admin operations like Add Device, Delete Device, Update Device and so on. This made it\npossible for the admin interface to provide different functionality from the user, as onboarding\nlogic closely follows the RBAC. This provided the admin with a UI that could handle many\ndevices in an easily navigable way. By the end of the day I managed to produce a full Figma\nprototype, both for the user and admin dashboard. This prototype was later turned into a design\nspecification that the i could refer to during the development.\nFigure 4: Admin panel design Figure 5: Admin panel design\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n25.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n13\n\nDay 9:\nI spent the day on designing databases. I made an ERD with PgSQL to visualize some of the\nrelationships between tables. I had defined simple tables like user details, device information,\nrooms and 'users and room' relationship. After that I had to set fields for the tables (like user\ntable: ID, name, email and password hash | device table: ID, device name, status information\nand room id). I used principles of normalization to guide data structure decisions. This in turn\nworked towards eliminating data redundancy and aiming to make it a high performance\ndatabase that is scalable. I also worked on the database so as to fit the UI requirements and I\nconsidered where what should be listed, which data we filter on frontend etc. This approach\nprovided a data flow base for the app.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n28.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n14\n\nDay 10:\nI started to design APIs on the backend. The first plan I had was to create two distinct API sets:\none for users and another for the administrators. I established the endpoints for these APIs, as\nwell as the HTTP methods with which they would be accessed and then request-response\nstructures for each endpoint. i.e On the user side, I created something like GET /devices to get\nthe list of devices and PUT /devices/:id to update device status. On the admin side, I created\nfunctions like POST /devices for adding devices and DELETE /devices/:id for deleting them. I\nalso took care of authentication and authorization while doing so. I had lines on paper for layers\nof security, like user auth via JWT & additional permission system applied to the admin actions. I\nalso needed to standardize error messages, have consistent responses and API documentation\ngenerated using something like Swagger. This means frontend and backend teams could\n\"speak the same language\", and series of future possible integration problem was even\nlessened.\nFigure 6: API endpoints Figure 7: API endpoints\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n29.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n15\n\nDay 11:\nI spent today managing project file structure. Firstly I sorted out how my file structure would\nlook, creating folders for components, services, assets and configuration. > This was to avoid\nany future confusion in both front end and backend. De-coupling the code in a modular fashion\nnot only speeded up development, but also made life easier when it came to maintaining and\ndebugging.\nI also attempted to emulate the workflow of an actual software team, based on sayings found in\nprofessional projects. I outlined things like; which of theirs to put where, how we should group\nup components and manage state, and how deep in the stack calls for their services would be.\nThat reduced the chance of future disruptions and made a more reliable development\nenvironment.\nFigure 8: Backend structure Figure 9: Frontend structure\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n30.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n16\n\nDay 12:\nA lot of the technology I’d be working with was ne",

Before I started, I made sure to be set up on my\ndevelopment environment including an IDE package managers such as npm, version controls\nlike git, testing tools like Postman and a database tool DBeaver.\nOnce installed, I required the packages for the project, set up environment and tested\nconfigurations. I was able to more easily move into project development after the installation,\ndue to detailed planning I had done ahead of time. This period allowed me to discover a lot of\ntechs, and paved the way for a much easier time in my next stages.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n31.07.2025 Betül Nur İyican\nDay 13:\nI began frontend programming with React. I originally targeted user login screens. I made the\nauthentication and main log in screens. Leveraging React component model, I split each of this\nfn to separate components. I saved time and kept the code cleaner by creating reusable\ncomponents, especially with list structures.\nI used React's state for this. I made sure that every change in data is instantly displayed to\navoid performance degradation. Hot reload also helped me in testing my changes right away. A\nshort investigation I did of React in advance let me be more mindful of how to clearly take\nadvantage its strengths. This made the first few pages super easy to put together.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n1.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n17\n\nDay 14:\nToday, I focused heavily on front-end development, particularly building both the login and\nregistration interfaces. The forms themselves had a polished look, and I implemented real-time\nvalidation to provide immediate feedback; misspelled emails or missing fields were flagged\nwithout delay.\nThroughout the process, I maintained constant communication with my mentor to anticipate\npotential issues and verify the app's stability. While I was still figuring out the intricacies of\nReact's state management and the interaction of props, I observed that the data flow remained\nconsistent and correct. Frequent comparisons between my code and the Figma prototypes\nhelped ensure the UI closely aligned with the intended design specifications.\nAt the end of the day, I showed my mentor what I had done and called it a day.\nFigure 10: Register page Figure 11: Login page\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n04.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n18\n\nDay 15:\nI went further with other screens of the user panel. I particularly made room and device\nmanagement pages. In those pages, I added functionality that allows the user to manage\ndevices, obtain a list of rooms, and add new records.\nIn this stage, I created and reused card parts. Therefore, I used the same part per device or\nroom and avoided code duplication. With this approach, the project became more modular and\nthe interface more uniform. I also ensured responsive design with a layout that works well with\nscreens of different dimensions.\nFigure 12: Rooms page\nFigure 13: Device detail page\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n05.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n19\n\nDay 16:\nThe day was dedicated to the admin panel. From the pages that I developed at the user end, I\ndeveloped similar screens at the admin end. But the admin panel required additional buttons\nand administrative actions. I took special interest in active/deactive buttons and developed\nmechanisms that allow you to change the status of the device or the end-users.\nComponent architecture of React simplified the process of transitioning from the UI to the admin\ninterface. With the addition of subtle changes in designs, I integrated privileged admin\nfunctionality into the system. Although I needed to implement some minor changes in the plan\nalong the process, the project generally turned out efficiently and promptly.\nFigure 14: Admin panel rooms\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n06.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n20\n\nDay 17:\nHaving finished the basic development on the front-end aspect, I went on with the back-end. I\nfirst established the PostgreSQL database environment with Docker. As the latter happened to\nbe my first encounter with Docker, I first had to get familiar with container logic. I went through\nand prepared the Dockerfile and docker-compose settings.\nHaving established the connection with the database, I generated the SQL scripts and\nimplemented them into the project file system. I applied the initial migration and populated the\ntables into the database. Although this process wasn't real-time, Docker provided a more\nportable, reliable, and deployable environment. This step became invaluable for me personally,\nboth as a learning process with a new technology and as shaping the professional organization\nof the project.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n07.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\nDay 18:\nOn the server-side, I developed the authentication APIs. I crafted the methods that allow the\ncreation of a registered user and their login and session handling. Here, I utilized the use of\nstandardized data input and output via the DTO (Data Transfer Object) pattern. Using this, both\nrapid development and uniform data flow were achieved.\nFirst, I tested the APIs with Postman. I learned how to test through a few minute videos as I at\nfirst struggled with it. When checking endpoints, I ensured I got correct responses and failed\nrequests were getting correct error responses. I also verified if actually registered users were\ncorrect through inspecting the database through DBeaver. It assisted me both in learning API\ntesting and successfully implementing the authentication module.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n08.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n21\n\nDay 19:\nToday I used a JWT (JSON Web Token)-based authentication system in my project. Earlier, I\nonly got acquainted with the theory of JWT, but this time I could use it with an actual project.\nUsing it this way helped me realize mechanisms of authentication and authorization used in a\nproject-based setting.\nI browsed through the docs and example projects and learned how a JWT is created, at what\nstage it's sent to the client, and how it's embedded in the header with every request. I needed to\nresearch extensively, especially to understand the difference between access tokens and\nrefresh tokens and how to prevent security risks. When I tested the APIs, I utilized Postman and\ntested the behavior of the token. However, as JWT isn't an exclusive requirement of\npoint-to-point authentication, I could not perform the tests I wished to carry out under certain\nconditions. My trial and error learning at this point educated me about the importance of secure\nsystem architecture.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n11.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\nDay 20:\nI implemented API endpoints of devices and rooms today. I encountered more problems\ncontinuing with this phase of work than I first expected, specifically while working with enum\ntypes of the PostgreSQL database. Having no prior knowledge of specifying enum types while\nmigrating and managing them at the database level, I had no option other than carrying out\nextensive research.\nTo resolve the issues, I conducted a lot of experiments both from the backend code and from\nthe SQL. I also looked at best practices of enum definition from a number of sources and\nderived a solution that may work with my project. I tested the created APIs using Postman and\nvalidated the results from a performance as well as an accuracy standpoint.\nI also actively utilized the JWT token during this time. I played around with how the authorization\nheader is sent during requests by sending the token via Postman and how error responses were\ncreated with attempts missing the token. It gave a further insight into how JWT actually works in\npractice.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n12.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n22\n\nDay 21:\nI completed the API endpoints that I specially designed for the admin today. I separated the\nuser's and the admin's roles and implemented a role-based access control (RBAC) system. It\nprevented non-administrative users from carrying out specific tasks.\nApart from authentication of JWT at the backend level, I further implemented role-based control.\nIt means a user could not access a relevant endpoint regardless of how much their token could\nbe valid if they were not possessing the admin role. It created an opportunity of utilizing the\nmost utilized approach of real-world applications of an enterprise type.\nDuring my testing with Postman, I tested each of the user and admin roles separately. I\ndiscovered that restrictions were working as expected at the user end and everything was\nsmooth on the admin end. This step enlightened me regarding the importance of not only JWT\nbut also of authorization systems and how they should actually be implemented into the project.\nFigure 15: Authorization control Figure 16: Authorization control\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n13.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n23\n\nDay 22:\nToday I began combining the frontend and the backend. I first combined the authentication\nprocesses. I checked whether the input data during login and register processes were properly\nsent into the backend. Then I checked whether the latter were actually processed through the\ndatabase with the aid of DBeaver.\nI also added a manual user I created as the admin into the database. Then I used the user and\ntried out the process of being directed back into the system's admin interface. When I included\nthe proper scripts into the database, I could spot that the backend operated with the frontend.\nOne of the principal operations that this step carried out involved ensuring that data were both\ninserted and fetched out of the database correctly.\nFigure 17: AuthService page\nFigure 18: DBeaver users table\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n14.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\n24\n\nDay 23:\nThe devices and rooms related APIs were then integrated in the front-end in a following stage.\nEspecially the data binding was crucial here. I spent some time learning how to show data from\nthe backend on the frontend and update with user interaction.\nI also looked at the discrepancies between the admin and user signs on what they saw in the\nUI. As an example, the admin’s login presented a lot more buttons and options than did the\nstandard user login, and provided not much possibility for actions. I tested this and the system\ngets it right!\nThis phase taught me the value of communication between frontend and backend, and showed\nme what role-based UI design looked like in practice.\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n15.08.2025 Betül Nur İyican\nDay 24:\nToday, after integrating the admin API endpoints beyond my personal alignment into the\nfrontend, I realized that user and admin operations were complete. All the core functions\nneeded by both users and admins were operational.",
