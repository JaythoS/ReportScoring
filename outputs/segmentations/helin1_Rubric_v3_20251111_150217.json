        "content": "Executive Summary\nCore4Basis Technology and Consulting Services is a consulting boutique SAP Basis\nspecialty firm. The company provides SAP system installation, upgrade, performance\noptimization, security, backup, and cloud integration services. Its main goal is to assume\nresponsibility for customers' key infrastructures with best-in-class performance and\nreliability.\nDuring my internship, I was a very active member of the daily business processes of\nthe SAP Basis team. I learned checking the systems with the help of SAP GUI, preparing daily\nand weekly reports, and performing backup controls and dump analyses. I also performed\nuser and authorization procedures. Besides that, I prepared weekly system status reports for\ndifferent clients, which included reading system logs, RFC connections, disk space usage,\nmemory space usage, and other important parameters.\nA significant amount of my internship was devoted to being involved in the SAP\nHANA patching process. Under the guidance of my supervisor, I performed full system\nbackups, downloaded the relevant .SAR files from SAP Support Portal, and uploaded them to\nthe respective directories. I powered down the system safely via SAP MMC and initiated the\nupdate process through the hdblcm tool. I learned that careful planning, backup, and check\nsteps are so critical in system updates.\nMoreover, I was taught SAP service management on the SUSE Linux and Windows\nServer platforms by my supervisor. I learned to use terminal commands (df -h, top, ps -ef,\nstartsap, stopsap) and to work with directories. On the Windows platform, I was trained to\nstart and stop instances using SAP Management Console (SAP MMC) and to effectively\nmanage services.\nBefore the internship, my main goal was to learn more about SAP Basis\ninfrastructure and become familiar with the actual systems. This internship exceeded my\nexpectation. I learned the importance of regular system checks, proper documentation, and\ncollaboration in SAP system maintenance. In addition, I obtained experience which SAP Basis\nrequires as much technical knowledge as taking a high level of responsibility. This internship\nassisted me in achieving technical skills and professional working ethics.\n2",

        "content": "8\n\nA ) Impact\nMy internship experience at Core4Basis gave me valuable insights into how SAP Basis\nsolutions could contribute significantly to global, economic, environmental, and societal\ncontributions. SAP systems constitute a significant component of digital infrastructure of\ncompanies around the world. They are used in managing the core business processes like\nfinance, logistics, manufacturing, and human resources. The work I performed and\nobserved—e.g., daily system monitoring, backup management, log scanning, and software\npatching—are technical and plain-looking tasks, but ones with extremely important\nconsequences when viewed as part of a bigger picture.\n- Global Impact:\nSAP Basis solutions enable companies with a global presence to function flawlessly\nworldwide. Stable ERP systems ensure that supply chains, financial transactions, and data\nexchange across geographical regions occur without disruption. If an ERP system of massive\nscale fails, the consequence will be felt across the globe, resulting in delays in production,\nshipping, or financial processes in various markets. The efforts of SAP Basis engineers,\nincluding routine monitoring and patching, deliberately prevent such interference and\nenable business continuity globally. Such reliability is required in today's globalized world\neconomy in businesses that manage cross-border businesses and trade.\n- Economic Impact :\nERP systems have a direct effect on the economic efficiency and competitiveness of\norganizations. System downtime will lead to colossal financial loss, production delays, and\neven damage to reputation. SAP Basis engineers minimize the risk of operation by\nconducting operations such as system checks, database backups, and software updates in\ntime. This enhances productivity, saves costs, and gives companies the potential to make\ninformed data-based decisions. The reports that we have prepared during our internship\nassisted in decision-making by providing real system health and performance data. Marginal\nimprovements in system efficiency in large business organizations make a huge difference in\ncost and enhanced resource utilization, which in the end contributes to economic growth.\n- Environmental Impact:\nSAP systems also help promote environmentally friendly business practices. ERP systems\nintegrated give companies the capacity to plan their logistics, production, and resource\nplanning in a more efficient manner that can reduce energy usage and waste. Cloud-based\nSAP solutions, which are popular with companies, reduce energy usage through aggregated\ninfrastructure and shared resources. Through activities such as HANA patching and system\ntuning, I acquired knowledge on how updates and performance improvements maintain\nsystems with less usage but are yet more efficient, indirectly reducing the environmental\nfootprint of IT operations.\n9\n\n- Societal Impact:\nError-free ERP systems guarantee that societal well-being is facilitated by industries providing\nbasic services. Fields such as healthcare, banking, transportation, and government\nadministration rely on secure and stable systems in order to offer services to millions of\npeople. SAP Basis engineers are tasked with ensuring that the systems operate without\ninterruption. Beyond this, security of data and confidentiality—a key part of SAP Basis—is a\nmajor social matter nowadays in the digital age. Through performing user management,\nauthorization, and audit reporting operations, I understood how the engineers protect\nsensitive data and maintain legal and ethical compliance.\nIn short, the engineering activities that I observed throughout my internship—system\nmonitoring, backup administration, log analysis, and patching—are technical in nature. They\nhave extensive impacts on global trade, economic efficiency, environmental sustainability,\nand public trust in computer systems. With new technologies such as artificial intelligence,\nbig data analysis, and cloud computing defining the future, SAP Basis engineers will be asked\nto implement these solutions even more responsibly. My internship experience showed that\nall stable ERP systems have engineers behind them to make sure that companies can operate\nsecurely, efficiently, and sustainably across the globe.\nB ) Team Work\nAt Core4Basis, I was exposed and involved in a very collaborative team environment.\nMy senior SAP Basis engineers acted as my mentors, closely monitoring me, explaining\ntechnical processes and reviewing my work when necessary. Senior SAP Basis consultants\nwith a background in computer engineering and information systems were responsible for\noperating client systems, performing updates, and addressing technical issues.\nMy role in the team was to support them by giving them daily and weekly reports,\nhelping in HANA patch-related tasks, and learning basic OS-level administrative skills.\nMeanwhile, while I assisted with easy tasks, the consultants were engaged in more complex\nconfigurations, client conversations, and resolving issues.\nWe were in constant communication using Microsoft Teams, sharing work progress,\ntroubleshooting system problems, and planning patch schedules. Inside the office too, we\nhad short discussions to make quick decisions as a group. Our team was well-organized with\nclear job assignments for each member and a supervisor managing the general workflow.\nThe organization and performance of the team were greatly effective. Each person\nknew their role, supported each other, and collaborated to achieve common goals. This\nenvironment showed me the importance of interdependence, communication, and task\ndistribution in technical projects. It also showed me the importance of having a positive\nattitude towards teamwork, showing that fruitfully cooperating teams can learn from each\nother.\n10\n\nC) Self-directed Learning\nWhile interning at Core4Basis, I realized that lifelong and autonomous learning is the\nprinciple to professional growth in information technology. SAP Basis administration requires\ncontinuous learning because enterprise systems, cloud computing, and security controls\nkeep evolving. Through my internship, I had experience in taking the initiative, independent\nlearning on a topic, and learning from beyond the given tasks.\nI also identified other areas of professional practice knowledge. The areas are a more\nthorough examination of SAP HANA architecture, Linux operating system management, and\nadvanced database backup and recovery strategies. I further emphasized the acquisition of\nthese soft skills: proper documentation, efficient communication, and time management\nwhen working in a team.\nAlong with the support activities like the SAP HANA patching process, supplementary\ninformation was needed to understand how to do the steps in backups, file management\nupdates, and shutdown and startup of the system.I learned this from official SAP documents\non the SAP Support Portal, technical manuals on the SAP Help portal, and the corresponding\ntraining videos and discussion forums. My manager advised me to dig into these sources,\nwhich allowed me not only to learn what to do, but why one had to do it.\nThroughout the internship period, I had the practice of putting down notes on all the\nwork that I executed, the commands utilized by us in Linux, SAP transactions utilized during\nsome activities, and the overall process for system monitoring as well as patching. Having\nsuch a record kept helped me recollect what I had studied and also acted as a personal\nreference for future utilization.\nThis experience helped me build my independent learning skills, technical research\nproblems, and adapting to new things. It further revealed to me that in the world of IT,\nexperts have to refresh their knowledge continually, in order to keep up with emerging\ntechnologies such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity software. My\ninternship made me urge to continue to learn, a skill essential to stay in the line of work as\nan engineer.\n11",

Daily Activities\n● Day 1 , 10.06.2025 - Installation and download\nI met my supervisors and my teammates at the office and we talked about SAP Basis\nPrinciples.\nFirstly, I installed Microsoft Office 365 Programs, with all the meetings and\ndocuments around here.\nAfter that I received S-User ID and Password for SAP Me SubPortal from my\nsupervisor and I logged into the system.\nFigure 1 : Me SAP Portal\nAfterall i installed FortiClient VPN to access the customer's system.\nAt the beginning I had a problem which was about Name access requirements. I was trying\non the FortiClient 7.4 version on my Mac computer but Name was required so I checked\nFortiClient Support. Probably my pc didn't support the 7.4 version and I installed the 7.2\nversion again.\nFigure 2 : FortiClient VPN\n13\n\nThan, I should have downloaded SAP GUI, and i installed JAVA 8 SE because SAP\nGUI7.50rev1 only accessible at JAVA8. After, I had a problem that the GUI didn't reach my\nJava and I googled it. My problem was solved by downloading the SAP GUI 7.70 version.\nFigure 3 : SAP GUI for Java Installation\nFigure 4 : Terminal Screen with Java Version\nFigure 5 : SAP GUI\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n14\n\n● Day 2 , 11.06.2025 - SAP Structures and SAP GUI\nI learned about the three-tier architecture of the SAP system: Presentation Layer,\nApplication Layer, and Database Layer. The users access the system through SAP GUI, which is\ncommunicated with one or more application servers using a message server. The application\nservers, in return, communicate with the database layer.I also checked SAP GUI logon pad,\nwhere different system entries (clients) are saved. I saw that each entry has a system ID,\ninstance, and connection.\nFigure 5 : SAP System Architecture (Three-Tier Structure)\nFigure 6 : HANA Database Access via Command Line\nFigure 7: SAP GUI Logon Pad with System Entries\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n15\n\n● Day 3 , 12.06.2025 - Weekly Periodic Analysis Reporting Description\nI reviewed the weekly periodic analysis report used in the SAP system. The report\nincluded technical checks such as weekly backup control, performance monitoring, dump\nanalysis, system logs, and disk usage. I observed how data was entered on a daily basis into\nthe Excel table and how detailed checks were organized under specific tabs (e.g., Backup\nOverview, Database Disk). The data was retrieved from the SAP system using SAP GUI. By\nreading this report, I learned how SAP works day to day.\nFigure 8 : Periodic Analysis Reporting\nFigure 9 : Large Tables for Periodic Analysis Reporting\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n16\n\n● Day 4 , 13.06.2025 - Audit Reporting Description\nI worked with an Excel worksheet for tracking audit and authorization requests in the\nSAP system. It addressed key control points such as active user and deleted user lists, admin\nauthorizations (SAP_ALL & SAP_NEW), critical authorizations, system parameters\n(RSPARAM), and profile monitoring. Each request was included along with the corresponding\nSAP report name and its status, overwhelmingly set to \"Requested,\" with comments\nreferencing other sheets. I learned that information was extracted via SAP GUI and logged on\nExcel for the purpose of supporting audit and access control processes.\nFigure 10 : Audit Report Requests and User Information System\nFigure 11 : Display View of Client Settings\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n17\n\n● Day 5 , 16.06.2025 - Individual Weekly Reporting Trying\nI was given the responsibility of preparing the company's weekly reports under the\nsupervision of IÇ, and OT. I logged into the SAP system as a host user on my own, extracted\nnecessary data, and pasted it into Excel templates.\nThis exercise involved monitoring system activity and extracting critical data that was\nrequired by the company. It helped me improve my SAP navigation, management of data,\nand precision of reports.\nFigure 12 : Weekly Activity Planning and Reporting Table\nFigure 13 : SAP GUI Interface Displaying System Log Data for Weekly Reporting\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n18\n\n● Day 6 , 17.06.2025 - User Creation Training in SAP GUI\nI was taught by my supervisor how to add a new user into the SAP system using the\nSAP GUI. I learned how to go to the user screen and enter details like name, department,\nphone, and email. My supervisor also taught me how to assign roles and profiles such that\nthe user can access the right areas. From this training, I was able to understand the basics of\nmanaging users and adding users in SAP correctly.\nFigure 14 : SAP GUI User Creation Screen – Personal and Company Information Entry\nFigure 15 : SAP GUI User Role and Profile Assignment Panel\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n19\n\n● Day 7 , 18.06.2025 - Meeting About Daily SAP Reports\nOn this day, we had an online meeting with our supervisor to learn how to prepare\ndaily SAP system reports. During the meeting, our supervisor explained how to fill in the\ndaily control report and what each item means. He showed us how to check backups, dump\nanalysis, RFC connections (both inbound and outbound), database usage, and instance\nstatus. We also learned how to write down problems if something is not working correctly.\nThis meeting helped me understand how to follow the daily reporting process and how to\nuse the SAP system more effectively.\nFigure 16 : Online Meeting Explaining SAP Daily Report Template via SAP GUI\nFigure 17 :SAP FIORI Cockpit – System Monitoring Dashboard Showing CPU, Memory, and\nInstance Performance Metrics\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n20",

I followed the template shown by my supervisor and used SAP GUI to check\nsystem information. Each day, I checked important items like backup status, dump analysis,\nRFC connections, database usage, and instance performance. I entered the results into the\nExcel report, just as we practiced. Sometimes, I also connected to the SAP Cockpit to confirm\nsystem health and get more detailed data. I carefully followed the instructions to avoid any\nmistakes and to make sure the reports were complete. This helped me practice what I\nlearned in the meeting and gain more confidence using SAP tools.\nFigure 18 : SAP Daily System Report\nFigure 19 : Saved Daily Excel Reports (DEP) Showing Dates and File Versions for 18–20 June\n2025\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n21\n\n● Day 10 , 23.06.2025 - Weekly (Every Monday) System Status Check – 5\nCompanies\nI reviewed and compiled weekly (every Monday) system status reports for five\ndifferent companies. This included checking server logs, system availability, backup statuses,\nand any service alerts. Each company’s infrastructure was analyzed separately, and findings\nwere documented for weekly monitoring purposes.\nFigure 20 : Weekly System Status Excel Report for SAP ERP – Multi-Company Monitoring\nFigure 21 : Saved Weekly Reports for 5 Different Companies with Timestamped Filenames like\nthis Checklist\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n22\n\n● Day 11 , 24.06.2025 - Day 12 , 25.06.2025 - Server Check for Two Companies\nOn these two days, I worked on checking the servers of two different companies.\n- I looked at each server’s IP address, hostname, and operating system in the Excel file.\n- Then, I used a remote terminal (like RDP or SSH) to connect to each server one by one\n- I checked if I could log in using the username and password.\n- If I could not log in, I wrote down the problem (for example: server is off, wrong password,\nconnection error).\n-I also checked the SAP service accounts and other information to make sure everything is\ncorrect.\n-I marked the results in the Excel file using colors (green for OK, red for problems).\nThis task helped keep the company’s server list up to date and made sure all systems\nwere checked.\nFigure 22 : Server Status Control Excel - Access Check and Verification Results\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n23\n\n● Day 13 , 26.06.2025 - Day 14 , 27.06.2025 - SAP Log & Audit Report\nAnalysis for Legal Request\nOn this days, I was responsible for analyzing SAP user activity logs in response to a\nlegal investigation request. A client had filed a lawsuit claiming they worked overtime beyond\nregular hours, and our company was asked to provide evidence of their SAP login history\nfrom 2020 onwards.\n● I accessed the SAP system and checked the user’s logon/logoff data for each month.\n● I used audit tools such as SM20 (Security Audit Log), STAD, SUIM, and ST03N to\nextract historical records.\n● I reviewed transaction usage (e.g., VA03, SE16N, SM37) and audit texts like “Logon\nsuccessful” and “User Logoff”.\n● I organized the results month-by-month into separate Excel files (e.g.,\n01.01.2020–31.01.2020–CKAHRAMAN.XLSX).\n● Each Excel file included detailed data such as terminal ID, transaction code,\ntimestamps, and program logs.\n● I structured and named the files consistently to make them easier to archive and\nanalyze.\nThis task helped provide solid technical evidence for the ongoing legal case. It also improved\nmy skills in SAP log analysis, data organization, and compliance-related auditing.\nFigure 23: Full-Year SAP Audit Log Breakdown by Month for User Figure 24: Sample Excel File Structure for SAP\nAudit Data - Monthly User Activity\n24\n\nFigure 25 : Detailed SAP Audit Log for a Single Month – January 2024\nDate Supervisor’s Name Signature\n25\n\n● Day 15 , 30.06.2025 - Weekly (Every Monday) System Status Check – 5\nCompanies\nI reviewed and compiled weekly (every Monday) system status reports for five\ndifferent companies.

The backups were saved under\n/hana/data/backup with the prefixes COMPLETE_SYS_BACKUP_NHD and\nCOMPLETE_TENANT_BACKUP_NHD. I confirmed the backup files via the command line. This\nstep was essential to prevent data loss during the update.\nFigure 27 :HANA Studio interface showing the complete data backup settings for both\nSYSTEMDB and tenant database (NHD@NHD).\nFigure 28 : Terminal view showing backup files in /hana/data/backup\nAfter completing the backup, I started the HANA update preparations. I downloaded the\nrequired .SAR files (IMDB_SERVER20, IMDB_CLIENT20, HDB_LCM20) from the SAP Support\nPortal and moved them to the /hana/shared/SAP_DOWNLOADS directory. I then safely\nstopped the HANA system via SAP MMC and verified the files and folder structure through\nthe terminal to ensure the system was ready for the update.\nFigure 29 :Downloaded HANA server update files from SAP Support Portal.\nFigure 30: Stopping the HANA Figure 31: Terminal view showing\nsystem via SAP MMC. transferred .SAR files.\n27\n\nFigure 32 :SAP Support Portal download list for HANA Client 2.25.\nFigure 33 : Terminal view showing the transferred HANA installation files under\n/hana/shared/SAPDVD, organized into SAP_HANA_CLIENT and SAP_HANA_DATABASE\ndirectories.\nFigure 34 : Detected HANA components and versions during update.\nFigure 35 : Command line interface showing the start of SAP HANA Database and Client patch\nupdate process.\n28\n\nFigure 36 : Live update progress showing SAP HANA packages being patched and\ncomponents updated.\nIn Summary:\n1.
